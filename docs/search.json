    "text": "Welcome to the üòé Summer 2024 Season üåΩ of Statasaurus!\nHistory\nStatasaurus (a.k.a. Stats-Hub) is a series of encounters designed to share, discuss, learn, and use applied stats and computer programming for agricultural research. It was born in late Fall 2018 from the idea of several lab mates (Adrian Correndo, Santiago Tamagno, Javier Fernandez, and Luiz Moro Rosso) with the support of their advisor (Dr.¬†Ciampitti) at the KSU Crops team (now CiampittiLab). And now, it moved to Guelph!\nStatasaurus was conceived with the main goal sharing knowledge about data analysis using R software. By that time, we were mostly using excel for data wrangling, GraphPad Prism for plots, barely used R script files, no Rmarkdown for reports, and no version control. We didn‚Äôt even know how to create an *.Rproj file. Rapidly, the entire team adopted the idea and the rest is known history. Over the years, many graduate students, visiting scholars, and postdocs have been sharing their coding and stats knowledge (and doubts) allowing the team to exponentially grow in terms of data analytics skills. Nowadays, we are proudly using these meetings exclusively for advanced programming topics. Welcome to the team!\nGeneral Rules\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe #1 and most important rule is: exchange!\nThe willing to contribute is of central importance cause we all have duties to take care about. Therefore, self-volunteers are crucial and deeply appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe meetings are not lectures. Nobody‚Äôs bringing the truth! We are all learning, so we foster the discussion among members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is expected that members have:\ni. the latest version of RStudio installed.\nii. an active GitHub account, and‚Ä¶\niii. training on the basics of data analysis using R."
