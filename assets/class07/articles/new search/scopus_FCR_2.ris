AB  - In recent decades, increases in wheat yield have been achieved mainly through increases in grain number per m2 (GNM2) rather than through increases in average grain weight (AGW). Using AGW as a lever to increase yield would require avoidance of the negative relationship between GNM2 and AGW. It is usually supposed that this trade-off arises from an increase in the proportion of small grains as GNM2 rises. The proportional increase in small grains being the result either of (1) an increase in the proportion of secondary tillers in the spike population or (2) of an increase in the proportion of grains located in distal positions within each spike. Either or both of these two populational effects would tend to mask any true genotypic differences in AGW. The existence of these constitutive differences has already been proposed, but without considering the full extent of the populational confounding effects. Identification of a component of the constitutive genetic determinism of AGW - one that is truly independent of GNM2 - could contribute to cultivar developments that would lead to further increases in grain yield under future target environments. To address this question, we analysed populational effects on AGW in four, modern, well-adapted bread-wheat cultivars. The four chosen cultivars show similar grain yields but contrasting AGWs. The analysis of populational effects was carried out at three hierarchical levels (the plot, the spike and the single grain) and under two contrasting environmental conditions (well-watered vs water-deficit conditions). Regardless of the environment, no (or only slight) differences in individual spike size were observed between cultivars. Furthermore the weak relationship between spike size and AGWdemonstrates that AGW differences between cultivars cannot be attributed to spike-level populational effects. Meanwhile, the analysis of individual grain mass distributions, showed that the differences in AGW between cultivars, originated from shifts in the whole grain-mass distribution, rather than from shape changes in the grain-mass distribution. This clearly indicates that AGW differences between cultivars cannot be attributed to populational effects at the individual grain level. The analysis carried out at both spike and individual grain levels indicates that the AGW differences between cultivars are largely constitutive, so that increases in grain yield through AGW may be considered independently of the GNM2: AGW trade-off. Taken together, these findings offer a new perspective for the genetic improvement of wheat, and one that should lead to further increases in yield. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Optimal nitrogen (N) fertilization for grass-clover leys is important, since the N application affects yields and the clover and crude protein (CP) contents of the forage. Modeling of optimal N application to maximize economic output and minimize environmental consequences depends on grass-clover responses, e.g., on clover proportion, dry matter (DM) and CP yield. Thus, such parameters need to be quantified in field trials. Based on a three-year field trial (2017–2019; Foulumgaard Experimental Farm, Denmark) with four cuts of an organically managed grass-clover ley, the effect of increasing N fertilization from cattle slurry (0, 50, 100, 200 and 300 kg total N ha-1) on DM yield, CP yield and concentration as well as on clover proportion was examined. Results were analyzed separately for four sward ages (1–4 years). Dry matter yields ranged from 5.8 to 11.8 Mg ha-1 and the 200 and 300 kg N ha-1 treatments showed the highest DM yield for all sward ages; the 300 kg N ha-1 showed no significant additional yield benefit relative to the 200 kg N ha-1. The clover proportion generally decreased with increasing N application (36–65 % for 0 N and 8–35 % for 300 kg N ha-1). The herbage concentration of CP was either unaffected or decreased with increasing N application. The fourth-year swards showed DM yields comparable to first and third-year sward ages. In unfertilized swards, a linear relationship was found between the first cut in a given year and the fourth cut of the previous year (r2 = 0.82 within a range of autumn clover proportions of 33–74 %), indicating the possibility of using last cut for predicting next year's fertilizer requirements. The comprehensive data and results may form the basis for future modeling of optimal N application in organic grass-clover leys. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - The increasing availability of complex, geo-referenced on-farm data demands analytical frameworks that can guide crop management recommendations. Recent developments in interpretable machine learning techniques offer opportunities to use these methods in agronomic studies. Our objectives were two-fold: (1) to assess the performance of different machine learning methods to explain on-farm wheat yield variability in the Northwestern Indo-Gangetic Plains of India, and (2) to identify the most important drivers and interactions explaining wheat yield variability. A suite of fine-tuned machine learning models (ridge and lasso regression, classification and regression trees, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machines, gradient boosting, extreme gradient boosting, and random forest) were statistically compared using the R2, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The best performing model was again fine-tuned using a grid search approach for the bias-variance trade-off. Three post-hoc model agnostic techniques were used to interpret the best performing model: variable importance (a variable was considered “important” if shuffling its values increased or decreased the model error considerably), interaction strength (based on Friedman's H-statistic), and two-way interaction (i.e., how much of the total variability in wheat yield was explained by a particular two-way interaction). Model outputs were compared against empirical data to contextualize results and provide a blueprint for future analysis in other production systems. Tree-based and decision boundary-based methods outperformed regression-based methods in explaining wheat yield variability. Random forest was the best performing method in terms of goodness-of-fit and model precision and accuracy with RMSE, MAE, and R2 ranging between 367 and 470 kg ha−1, 276–345 kg ha−1, and 0.44–0.63, respectively. Random forest was then used for selection of important variables and interactions. The most important management variables explaining wheat yield variability were nitrogen application rate and crop residue management, whereas the average of monthly cumulative solar radiation during February and March (coinciding with reproductive phase of wheat) was the most important biophysical variable. The effect size of these variables on wheat yield ranged between 227 kg ha−1 for nitrogen application rate to 372 kg ha−1 for cumulative solar radiation during February and March. The effect of important interactions on wheat yield was detected in the data namely the interaction between crop residue management and disease management and, nitrogen application rate and seeding rate. For instance, farmers’ fields with moderate disease incidence yielded 750 kg ha−1 less when crop residues were removed than when crop residues were retained. Similarly, wheat yield response to residue retention was higher under low seed and N application rates. As an inductive research approach, the appropriate application of interpretable machine learning methods can be used to extract agronomically actionable information from large-scale farmer field data. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Research for development efforts for increasing rice yield in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have largely concentrated on genetic improvement and agronomy for more than 50 years. Here we perform the first meta-analysis to quantify genetic gain - yield increase through use of new variety and calculated by yield difference between new variety and variety popularly grown in the target site, and agronomic gain - difference in yield between improved agronomic practices and the control in SSA using 208 paired observations from 40 studies across 12 countries. Among the studies, 41 %, 34 %, and 25 % were from irrigated lowland, rainfed lowland, and rainfed upland rice, respectively. Seventy percent of the studies reported in this paper were conducted on research stations. In agronomic practices, inorganic fertilizer management practices accounted for 78 % of the studies, of which 48 % were nitrogen (N) management. In each study, we identified four types of varieties: check variety (VC), variety with highest yield in the control (VHC), variety with highest yield under improved agronomic practices (VHT), and variety with largest yield difference between improved agronomic practices and control (VHR). VHT was the same as VHC in 35 % of observations, whereas VHR and VHT were the same in 51 %. These indicate that it is possible to develop varieties adapted to different agronomic practices and high-yielding varieties tend to be responsive to improved agronomic practices. On average, total gain in yield with improved agronomic practices and VHT was 1.6 t/ha. Agronomic practice accounted for 75 % of the total variation in total yield gain with variety and agronomic practice by variety interaction responsible for 19 % and 6 %, respectively. Genetic gains in yield with VHC, VHT, and VHR were 0.7, 0.3, and −0.3 t/ha in control, and 0.4, 0.9, and 0.5 t/ha in improved agronomic practices. Agronomic gain in yield averaged 0.5, 0.8, 1.4, and 1.6 t/ha in VHC, VC, VHT, and VHR, respectively. Agronomic gain in yield of VHT was higher than genetic gain under improved agronomic practices in 54 % of observations. Agronomic gain was highest in irrigated lowland rice, followed by rainfed lowland rice. Higher agronomic gain in yield was also associated with larger difference in N application rate between improved agronomic practices and control. Whereas agronomic practices had larger contribution to total gain in yield than genetic improvement in this study, future assessment of agronomic and genetic gains in yield is warranted. Such assessment should focus more on rainfed rice systems, where agronomic gain was small, take into account genetic improvement rate over time and integrated agronomic practices rather than single intervention like nutrient management practice only, and be conducted in farmers’ fields. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Perennial grain crops are being developed to reduce the negative environmental impacts of tillage and chemical inputs related to annual row-crop agriculture. To further improve the ecological benefits of perennial grains like Kernza® intermediate wheatgrass (IWG) [Thinopyrum intermedium (Host.) Barkw. &amp; D.R. Dewey], intercropping with perennial legumes has the potential to diversify grain production systems and reduce mineral N fertilizer requirements; however, the facilitative vs. competitive effects of various legume species on perennial grain yields are unknown. We compared grain and biomass yields, tissue C:N ratio, and δ15N of IWG in response to either mineral fertilizer treatments or intercropping with one of six legume species at three locations for three years. IWG tissue C:N ratio increased through time at all sites suggesting a consistent increase in N limitation. Although no legume intercrop consistently affected grain yields through time or across sites, very rarely did an intercrop reduce grain yields to levels less than fertilized and unfertilized IWG monocultures. However, legume biomass in year 1 was negatively correlated with IWG grain yields in year 1, suggesting that negative effects of competition may outweigh positive effects of N fixation and transfer the year following establishment. The relationship between legume biomass and IWG grain yield became positive by year 3, indicating a potential lag in the positive effects of legume intercrop on grain yield. At one location, red clover (Trifolium repens L.) biomass was higher than all other legume treatments in year 1 and declined through time, giving way to a subsequent increase in IWG biomass and grain yields through time. At this site, N transfer from legumes to IWG determined by δ15N was positive by year 3 for red clover and two other legume species. This study provides evidence that legume intercrops can benefit IWG production under certain conditions, but outcomes are site-specific and may depend on conditions related to soil N levels, temperature and precipitation patterns, and weed pressure. Research is needed to identify specific traits that promote legume coexistence and facilitation with IWG, and how these traits might rank in importance depending on environmental conditions. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Most of the experimental and modeling studies that evaluate the impacts of climate change and variability on barley have been focused on grain yield. However, little is known on the effects of combined change in temperature, CO2 concentration, and extreme events on barley grain quality and how capable are the current process-based crop models capture the signal of climate change on quality traits. Here in this review, we initially explored the response of quality traits of barley to heat, drought, and CO2 concentration from experiential studies. Next, we reviewed the state of the art of some of the current modeling approaches to capture grain quality. Lastly, we suggested possible opportunities to improve current models for tracking the detailed quality traits of barley. Heat and drought stress increase the protein concentration which has a negative effect on malting quality. The rise of CO2 concentration significantly reduces the grain protein, again resulting in a decline of the malting and brewing quality since the nitrogen concentration of grains needs to be kept at a specific level. The current crop models that simulate barley grain quality are limited to simulation of grain nitrogen concentration, size, and number in response to climate extremes and CO2. Nevertheless, crop models fail to account for the complex interactions between the conflicting effects of rising temperatures and droughts as well as increasing CO2 concentrations on grain protein. They have mainly adapted wheat models that cannot capture barley's protein composition and whole grain malting quality. Implementation of experiments from gene to canopy scales which are explicitly designed to detect the interactions among environmental variables on detailed quality traits and couple the remote sensing plus data-driven approaches to crop models are possible opportunities to improve modeling of barley grain quality. The development of modeling routines can capture the detailed grain quality provide valuable tools for forming climate adaptive strategies. Equally important, they can guide breeding programs to develop climate-resilient but high-quality barley genotypes. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Most of the required increases in food production over the next decades are expected to be achieved through increases in crop yield. As wheat is essential for food security it is worrying that its yield gains over the last two decades were small. To achieve further yield increases it is critical to continue increasing number of grains per unit area (GN m-2), the trait best related to yield. In this context, it is relevant to identify the main determinants of GN m-2 in response to genetic and environmental factors as well as the trade-offs between them. In the present study we compiled a large database across the literature to analyse the relative importance of components when affected by genetic or environmental factors, producing small or large changes in GN m-2 and its components, either numerical (the number of spikes per m2, SN m-2; and the number of grains per spike, GN spike-1) or physiological (spike dry weight at anthesis, SDWa; and fruiting efficiency, FE) determinants. The database included 367 papers published in: (i) Field Crop Research (FCR), (ii) European Journal of Agronomy (EJA), (iii) Crop Science (CS) and (iv) Crop and Pasture Science (CPS, formerly Australian Journal of Agricultural Research) between 1990 and 2020. The complete dataset was split into classes, depending on the source of experimental variation, environment or genotype and was normalised to remove the differences between experiments and determine the environmental and genotypic effects within each experiment. Normalised data showed that the responsiveness of GN m-2 was similarly explained by changes in both SN m-2 and GN spike-1, but in terms of physiological components SDWa was more relevant than FE for explaining the variations in GN m-2. Considering the numerical components of GN m-2 genotypic and environmental factors modified more GN spike-1 than in SN m-2. On the other hand, physiological components were differently modified by genotype and environment: for genotypic effects FE was more critical than SDWa and the other way around for environmental factors. A trade-off between numerical and physiological components was observed although was greater between physiological than between numerical components. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Weeds are one of the key threats in sustaining the productivity of the rice-wheat cropping system in the Indo-Gangetic Plains. The development of sound integrated weed management technologies requires knowledge of mechanisms that influence weed flora composition and weed seedbank dynamics. A long-term study was initiated in 2015 at Patna, Bihar, India to evaluate the effect of seven tillage and crop establishment methods on weed density, weed seedbank composition, and crop productivity in rice-wheat-mungbean rotation. All the treatments included zero-till mungbean after wheat. Tillage and crop establishment methods had differential effects on weed and weed seedbank composition. In rice, zero-till direct-seeded rice recorded 62% lower emergence of Cyperus iria, 82–90% of Echinochloa colona, and 81–83% of total weeds compared to tilled systems, but the system of rice and wheat intensification favoured E. colona. In wheat, the system of wheat intensification favoured the Phalaris minor and Solanum nigrum. Zero-till rice and wheat reduced the seedbank of Trianthema portulacastrum by 95%, and total weed seedbank by 62% compared to the system of rice and wheat intensification. Nearly, 72% of C. iria seeds, 62% of grasses, and 64% of broad-leaved weeds were in 0–15 cm soil layer. Zero-till direct-seeded rice produced a 13% lower rice grain yield than conventional puddled transplanted rice. Compared to the system of wheat intensification, zero-till wheat under triple zero-till systems produced an 11.5% higher grain yield. Managing weed seedbank is a long-term endeavour. The present study revealed that tillage and crop establishment methods influence weed density and diversity. Under zero-till rice-wheat system, rice yield decreases marginally, but the system productivity maintains due to improvement in succeeding wheat yield. This system is also helpful in reducing the weed flora density and soil weed seedbank. Regular monitoring and management of emerging pests such as armyworm (Mythimna separata) are, however, required. The study suggests that the adoption of triple zero-tillage can be a viable option for reducing the weed density and weed seedbank concurrently increasing the system productivity of the rice-wheat-mungbean cropping system in eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Reliable estimates of crop nitrogen (N) uptake and offtake are critical in estimating N balances, N use efficiencies and potential losses to the environment. Calculation of crop N uptake and offtake requires estimates of yield of crop product (e.g. grain or beans) and crop residues (e.g. straw or stover) and the N concentration of both components. Yields of crop products are often reasonably well known, but those of crop residues are not. While the harvest index (HI) can be used to interpolate the quantity of crop residue from available data on crop product yields, harvest indices are known to vary across locations, as do N concentrations of residues and crop products. The increasing availability of crop data and advanced statistical and machine learning methods present us with an opportunity to move towards more locally relevant estimates of crop harvest index and N concentrations using more readily available data. The aim of this study was to investigate whether improved estimates of maize crop HI and N concentrations of crop products and crop residues can be based on crop data available at the global scale, such as crop yield, fertilizer application rates and estimates of yield potential. Experiments from 1487 different locations conducted across 31 countries were used to test various prediction models. Predictions from mixed-effects models and random forest machine learning models provided reasonable levels of prediction accuracy (R2 of between 0.33 and 0.68), with the random forest method having greater accuracy. Although the mixed-effects prediction models had lower prediction accuracy than random forest, they did provide better interpretability. Selection of which method to use will depend on the objective of the user. Here, the random forest and mixed-effects methods were applied to N in maize, but could equally be applied to other crops and other nutrients, if data becomes available. This will enable obtaining more locally relevant estimates of crop nutrient offtake to improve estimates of nutrient balances and nutrient use efficiency at national, regional or global levels, as part of strategies towards more sustainable nutrient management. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Wheat dough characteristics and end-use quality are strongly influenced by the amount and specific composition of the glutenins, the major components of gluten. Such proteins are divided into high-molecular-weight glutenins, encoded by the Glu-A1, Glu-B1 and Glu-D1 loci; and low-molecular-weight glutenins, encoded by the Glu-A3, Glu-B3 and Glu-D3 loci. Allelic variation at each of these loci has been associated with changes in wheat functionality. However, most of the studies conducted so far included a relatively limited number of genotypes. Also for this reason, it is still unclear which locus contributes more to dough characteristics and how important are the interactions between the glutenin loci. To try to answer these questions, the quality data of 4623 grain samples derived from 2550 genotypes and generated across 10 years at the CIMMYT bread wheat breeding program, was used to estimate the effect of the glutenin loci and their interactions on gluten quality and bread-making potential. Gluten strength was the trait more strongly influenced by glutenin variations, with the Glu-B1, Glu-D1 and Glu-B3 loci having the greatest effect. Among the glutenin alleles, Glu-A1a, Glu-A1b, Glu-B1al, Glu-B1i, Glu-B1f, Glu-D1d, Glu-A3b, Glu-A3d, Glu-A3f, Glu-B3c and Glu-B3d were associated in general with greater gluten strength, good extensibility and higher bread loaf volume. Differently, alleles Glu-A1c, Glu-B1a, Glu-B1d, Glu-D1a, Glu-A3e and Glu-B3j were associated with an overall poor quality. Glutenin interactions were significantly associated with most of the analyzed quality traits even if their influence was often lower compared to the effect of the single glutenin loci. This is probably the largest study ever done on the effects of the glutenins on wheat quality. The results obtained confirm the importance of such proteins on wheat quality variation and corroborate the usefulness of determining the glutenin profile to improve the selection efficiency for wheat quality in breeding programs. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Continued global wheat yield increase (about 1.3% p.a. for 2000–2019) remains an essential condition for greater world food security. Relevant to this challenge is the rise in average farm yield (FY) of irrigated spring wheat in the Yaqui Valley of northwest Mexico from 2 to 7 t/ha between 1960 and 2019. Since the early 1950s the region has been the prime target of wheat research by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT) and its predecessors, research still having significant impact on wheat in the developing world, a grouping that today delivers more than half the world's wheat. FY increase was investigated in detail by dividing the interval into three 20-year periods, correcting FY for the strong influence of inter-annual variation in January to March minimum temperature (Tmin J-M, warming lowering yield around 7%/°C) and measuring the remaining linear increase in FY (Fischer et al., 2022). Total yield increase, corrected for Tmin J-M and CO2 rise, relative to average yield in each period, was 4.17%, 0.47%, and 1.59% p.a. for 1960–79, 1980–99, and 2000–19, respectively. The breeding component, estimated by the increase in the Varietal Yield Index in farmers’ fields, rose at 0.97%, 0.49%, and 0.71% p.a., respectively. The remaining yield change (3.16, −0.02% and 0.87% p.a., respectively) comprised the net effect of improved crop management (agronomic progress) plus that of off-farm changes, together here called agronomy+. Major changes in agronomy included: a large increase in fertiliser N use, benefitting early on from a large positive variety × N interaction; in the second period a switch to planting on raised beds and a decline in rotational diversity; and in the final period, consolidation of operational crop units and probably more skilful and timely management. Off-farm developments saw strong government financial support in the first period, but in the second period breakdown of the traditional small holder land system and withdrawal of government support. The last period saw better prices and improved access to technical advice. Breeding progress is expected to continue in the Yaqui Valley but at a slowly diminishing rate (currently 0.66% p.a.), while progress from new agronomy appears limited. Although FY gaps are small, some gap closing remains possible, and 1.2% p.a. FY progress is estimated for the next 20 years in the absence of new technologies. World wheat food security without area increase will increasingly depend on developing countries where yield gaps are generally wider and gap closing prospects better. Biophysical sustainability of the Yaqui Valley wheat system is moderately good but N management and diversity can be improved. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - The ways in which farmers implement conservation agricultural (CA) practices – which entail reduced tillage, maintenance of soil cover, and crop rotations – varies considerably in different environments, farming systems, and by the intensity with which farmers administer management practices. Such variability requires an efficient tool to evaluate the cost-benefit of CA, to inform agricultural policymakers and development priorities to facilitate expanded use of CA under appropriate circumstances. Rice-wheat rotation is the principal production system in South Asia (SA). Research has shown that CA can be promising in this rotation because of improved irrigated water, energy, and labor use efficiencies, in addition to the reduction in atmospheric pollution and potentially long term improvements in soil quality. Yield responses to CA are however varying across studies and regions. With a nine-year rice-wheat CA experiment in Eastern Gangetic Plains of South Asia, this study parameterizes the Environmental Policy Climate (EPIC) model to simulate five CA and conventional managements on the RW cropping system. Information from geospatial datasets and farm surveys were used to parameterize the model at the regional scale, increasing the management flexibility and range of localities in the simulation. Yield potential of the CAs in the whole SA was thereby explored by utilizing the model with various management strategies. Our results demonstrate how geospatial and survey data, along with calibration by a long-term experiment, can supplement a regional simulation to increase the model's ability to capture yield patterns. Yield gains from CA are widespread but generally low under current management regimes, with varied yield responses among CAs and environments. Conversely, CA has considerable potential in SA to increase rice-wheat productivity by up to 38%. Our results highlight the importance of applying an adaptive definition of CA, depending on environmental circumstances, while also building the capacity of farmers interested in CA to apply optimal management practices appropriate for their environment. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - We previously reported that extended and increased expression of the native maize gene zmm28 in maize resulted in transgenic events with greater grain yields under optimum field environments. Here we report additional positive impacts of altered zmm28 expression on improving yield stability of maize in the presence of the key abiotic stresses of water deficit and low nitrogen (N). Transgenic zmm28 elite hybrids were evaluated with their wild type (WT) comparators in multiple Managed Stress Environments (MSE), where a water deficit stress was imposed at flowering (FS) or during grain fill (GFS), or where N application was restricted (LN). Across 5 years of testing (2014–2018, 1600 comparisons, 80 hybrids, 43 locations), the ZmGos2-zmm28 lead event DP202216 increased yield relative to WT an average of 479 kg ha-1 (6.6%), 345 kg ha-1 (3.4%) and 166 kg ha-1 (2.0%) in FS, GFS and LN environments, respectively. Maximum observed yield response across 6–12 transgenic hybrids in a single location x year combination was 1181 kg ha-1 (13.9%), 860 kg ha-1 (9.4%) and 834 kg ha-1 (7.0%), relative to WT, for FS, GFS and LN, respectively. Another independent event, DP382118, provided similar yield improvements in the same environments, confirming overall confidence in the performance of the construct functional gene. In a separate genetic penetration study in 2018, DP202216 increased yield an average of 487 kg ha-1 (4.4%) over a combined set of GFS and FS locations, where 6 SS Bulk F3 populations were crossed with 6 diverse NSS testers (36 hybrids), confirming consistent positive yield responses across diverse germplasm under water-limited conditions. The improved yield stability of multiple elite ZmGos2-zmm28 transgenic hybrids demonstrated over multiple years of abiotic stress exposure indicates this novel transgenic variation can contribute to the sustainable intensification of maize production that will be required to address global yield gaps. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Rainfed crops rely on two sources of water: stored soil water at sowing and seasonal rain. In strongly seasonal winter-rainfall environments, stored soil water at sowing is minor, and uncertain seasonal rainfall is a source of risk. In south-eastern Australia, under-fertilisation is a common outcome of nitrogen risk management with implications for wheat yield and mining of soil organic matter. Here we explore the use of carbon isotope composition (δ 13C) to capture the effects of crop water status on grain yield in a context of nitrogen top dressing. In the sampled environments, crops receive at least 50% of seasonal rainfall by stem elongation, and at least 70% of seasonal rainfall by flowering. In a sample of 1518 plots, yield varied from 0.07 to 9.96 t ha-1 and correlated with δ 13C measured with isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) at flowering (r = −0.76, p &lt; 0.0001); this is consistent with the rainfall pattern and the physiology of the crop featuring a critical period for yield from 300 °Cd before to 100 °Cd after anthesis. In a sample of 135 plots, yield varied from 1.2 to 8.4 t ha-1 and correlated with δ 13C measured with IRMS at stem elongation (r = −0.56, p &lt; 0.0001). Yield response to nitrogen, defined as the difference between yield in fertilised crops (50–200 kg N ha-1) and unfertilised controls, correlated with δ 13C measured with IRMS at stem elongation, except for late-sown crops. Mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR) returned estimates of δ 13C that agreed with δ 13C measured with IRMS (calibration: R2 = 0.82, RMSE = 0.53‰, n = 833; validation: R2 = 0.70, RMSE = 0.75‰, n = 364). We conclude that a MIR based, high-throughput, affordable measurement of δ 13C could be scaled to guide nitrogen management of wheat in winter-rainfall environments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia (CRV), actual productivity of most cereals is less than 3 t ha−1 associated with low input use and poor crop management. After calibrating and validating the Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM) using experimental data, we explored and prioritized promising intensification options for rainfed maize and wheat that enable to narrow prevailing yield gaps in the CRV, and quantified trade-offs with the water balance and gross margins. We set up a factorial simulation experiment combining Genetic x Environment x Management factors that influence crop yield and water use at field scale to simulate yield and water balance components under current and future climate scenarios (pessimistic scenario for mid-century). Varietal selection and nitrogen (N) fertilization were the most important factors contributing to yield gap closure. Although yields were maximized with N application rates up to 250 kg−1 in most soils and varieties, maximum gross margin and maximum water use efficiency (WUE) were attained at lower N rates, associated with a small yield reduction compared to the maximum. There was a trade-off between intensification and increased absolute water use through transpiration, while the water use per kg product was decreased. However, location-specific N application rates that allow producing at least 80% of the water-limited potential yield (Yw) of maize and wheat resulted in high water use efficiencies as well as favorable cost-benefit ratios. Climate change was projected to lower yield as it advanced maturity, and to result in decreased drainage and increased soil evaporation across all variety, location and management combinations for both crops. Climate change reduced crop yield by 15–25% for wheat and 2–30% for maize. We conclude that the locally-calibrated APSIM model could be used to derive key lessons from the genetic, environment and management interactions, and generate information on sustainable intensification pathways that combine narrowing yield gaps with maximizing WUE and gross margins. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Crop yield forecasting at national level relies on predictors aggregated from smaller spatial units to larger ones according to harvested crop areas. Such crop areas come from land cover maps or reported statistics, both of which can have errors and uncertainties. Sub-national or regional crop yield forecasting minimizes the propagation of these errors to some extent. In addition, regional forecasts provide added value and insights to stakeholders on regional differences within a country, which would otherwise compensate each other at national level. We propose a crop yield forecasting approach for multiple spatial levels based on regional crop yield forecasts from machine learning. Machine learning, with its data-driven approach, can leverage larger data sizes and capture nonlinear relationships between predictors and yield at regional level. We designed a generic machine learning workflow to demonstrate the benefits of regional crop yield forecasting in Europe. To evaluate the quality and usefulness of regional forecasts, we predicted crop yields for 35 case studies, including nine countries that are major producers of six crops (soft wheat, spring barley, sunflower, grain maize, sugar beets and potatoes). Machine learning models at regional level had lower normalized root mean squared errors (NRMSE) and uncertainty than a linear trend model, with Wilcoxon p-values of 3e-7 and 2e-7 for 60 days before harvest and end of season respectively. Similarly, regional machine learning forecasts aggregated to national level had lower NRMSEs than forecasts from an operational system in 18 out of 35 cases 60 days before harvest, with a Wilcoxon p-value of 0.95 indicating similar performance. Our models have room for improvement, especially during extreme years. Nevertheless, regional crop yield forecasts from machine learning and aggregated national forecasts provide a consistent forecasting method across spatial levels and insights from regional differences to support important policy decisions. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Growing potatoes in temperate regions often leads to nitrogen (N) leaching, however this could be significantly reduced with drip irrigation and nitrogen fertigation if the timing and amounts of the applications matched the crop demand. Determination of when and how much to apply is not straightforward, particularly because the N mineralisation during the potato-growing season is unknown. The present study aimed at providing a solution by the means of a well-calibrated crop model. A comprehensive dataset from a two year experiment on subsurface drip irrigated and N-fertigated potato was used to calibrate and validate the Daisy model with focus on potato crop parameters. The experiment included two irrigation regimes combined with five different N fertigation levels. The calibrated model simulated LAI evolution, crop growth, N uptake and final tuber dry matter and N yield satisfactorily with discrepancies between the simulated and measured variables when simulations were evaluated treatment by treatment. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of the simulated tuber dry matter yield were 0.57 and 0.69 t DM ha-1 for the Folva cultivar in 2013 and Sava cultivar in 2014, respectively. For tuber nitrogen yield, RMSE of the model simulations were 9.7 and 12.8 kg N ha-1 in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Results demonstrated that the calibrated Daisy model could be used as a DSS tool for the optimal irrigation and fertigation of Folva and Sava potato cultivars. Compared to the experimental data the same tuber dry matter yield was simulated with substantial savings 30–55% and 35–50% of irrigation water and N fertiliser, respectively. Results indicated an overestimation of bare soil evaporation, and inconsistences in the simulated effects of water and N stresses on the crop. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - This in-depth analysis of the rise in farm yield (FY) of irrigated wheat in the Yaqui Valley of north-west Mexico, from around 2 to 7 t/ha between 1960 and 2019, begins by highlighting a weather component overlooked in modelling and other thinking about wheat and climate change, namely the dominant role of natural annual variation in minimum temperature (Tmin). Year to year fluctuations around the increasing yield trend were substantial (st.dev. 591 kg/ha) and were highly correlated negatively with annual fluctuations in the average Tmin January to March (Tmin J-M) which ranged from 5.0 to 11.5 oC in this period lasting from mid tillering to early-mid grain fill. Dividing the 60-year period into three consecutive 20-year periods and using multiple linear regression improved the accuracy of estimates of FY as a linear function of time in each period (responding inter alia to better technology including breeding and agronomy), with slopes of 4.5%, 0.6%, and 1.8% p.a. for 1960–79, 1980–99, and 2000–19, respectively. Tmin J-M coefficients were −218, −413, −406 kg/ha/oC, or −5.9, −8.1, −6.6%/oC, respectively, with R2 always close to 0.9. Combining results, the FY response to Tmin J-M was close to −7%/oC, such that over the 60-year period the Tmin J-M increase of 1.0 oC contributed a 7% reduction in FY at constant CO2. The improved estimate of FY slopes with respect to time revealed novel variation across the 60 year period to be dissected in a following paper. Annual fluctuations in Tmax J-M were not correlated with variation in Tmin J-M nor with variation in FY. Crop simulation modelling of potential yield (PY) corroborated the negative effect of increased Tmin J-M on yield and suggested that increased Tmin J-M primarily decreased days to anthesis, biomass and number of grains (/m2). Measurements retrieved from long term well-managed experiments in the Valley under constant agronomy and cultivars confirmed all the above predicted responses to Tmin J-M. Our results align with the few published studies increasing crop night temperature in the critical period of around 30 days up to the end of anthesis when grains/m2, and hence yield, was inversely related to rate of development. In the Yaqui Valley this was strongly associated with Tmin variation. This phenomenon, and the roles of Tmax and solar radiation (Rs) variation, are discussed in detail. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - A large database of individual farmer field data (n = 4,107) for rice production in the Northwestern Indo-Gangetic Plains of India was used to decompose rice yield gaps and to investigate the scope to reduce nitrogen (N) inputs without compromising yields. Stochastic frontier analysis was used to disentangle efficiency and resource yield gaps, whereas data on rice yield potential in the region were retrieved from the Global Yield Gap Atlas to estimate the technology yield gap. Rice yield gaps were small (ca. 2.7 t ha−1, or 20% of potential yield, Yp) and mostly attributed to the technology yield gap (ca. 1.8 t ha−1, or ca. 15% of Yp). Efficiency and resource yield gaps were negligible (less than 5% of Yp in most districts). Small yield gaps were associated with high input use, particularly irrigation water and N, for which small yield responses were observed. N partial factor productivity (PFP-N) was 45–50 kg grain kg−1 N for fields with efficient N management and approximately 20% lower for the fields with inefficient N management. Improving PFP-N appears to be best achieved through better matching of N rates to the variety types cultivated and by adjusting the amount of urea applied in the 3rd split in correspondance with the amount of diammonium-phosphate applied earlier in the season. Future studies should assess the potential to reduce irrigation water without compromising rice yield and to broaden the assessment presented here to other indicators and at the cropping systems level. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The increasing incidence and intensity of extreme climate events are a major threat to global crop production. Sugarcane represents the main source of sugar and ethanol in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Here, we assessed the impacts of climatic variability and extreme events on sugarcane yield gaps in Reunion Island which is characterised by extreme spatial contrasts in climate, and is regularly subjected to cyclones or drought. We combined a process-based crop model with spatial databases of soil, climate and management data, to predict the annual sugarcane yield in each field over the whole island from 1998 to 2018. Simulated yields were compared to actual sugarcane yields from sugar producers in five agro-climatic zones. Extreme climate indices were calculated for extreme daily rainfall, temperature and drought, and their influence on yield gap was assessed using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The average total yield gap (YGT, i.e. the difference between potential sugarcane yield and actual yield, Mg ha-1) over Reunion Island was 96 Mg ha-1, explained by 34% throw crop management and hazards. YG due to crop management reached 65 Mg ha-1 with increasing rainfall and nitrogen mineralization rate and up to 88 Mg ha-1 with increasing temperature and radiation. Yield gap was correlated with the first axis of the PCA, highlighting how extreme rainfall induced increase in YGT. The actual yield loss was defined as the difference between the actual yield from sugarcane producers in a given year and the highest yield obtained during the whole studied period in the same zone. The annual actual yield loss increased by 0.6 Mg ha-1 per rainfall days higher than 29 mm d-1 along the annual crop cycle. Using this approximation, average actual yield loss due to heavy rain was estimated as 5.5 Mg ha-1 but it was higher than 10 Mg ha-1 for 25% of years in the East coast region. Our results highlight the need for improving sugarcane crop yield response to extreme rain in process-based crop models, in order to better assess climate change impacts in future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Permanent raised beds (PB) are a conservation agriculture option for irrigated conditions that can improve soil quality, increase soil moisture conservation and stabilize yields compared to conventional furrow irrigation. In irrigated wheat (Triticum sp.) production, wet sowing (i.e. applying irrigation before sowing) is most widely used. It allows pre-sowing weed control but reduces sowing time flexibility. Dry sowing, i.e. applying irrigation after sowing, reduces options for weed control but improves water use efficiency and sowing time flexibility. This study evaluated the performance of durum wheat (Triticum durum L.) under conventionally tilled (CTB) and PB with wet and dry sowing in northwestern Mexico. In those four tillage-sowing irrigation environments (ENV), five nitrogen (N) fertilization treatments were tested. Plant stand, grain yield, and grain quality were measured for ten years and fertilizer-based N use efficiency indices were assessed in three years. Plant stand, wheat yield and quality were significantly affected by ENV. The lowest plant stand and yield were found in PB-Dry sowing. On average, only 54 plants m-2 emerged in PB-Dry whereas 159 plants m-2 emerged in CTB-Wet. Plant stand showed high yearly fluctuations, with plant stand in dry sowing favored by lower reference evapotranspiration, with CTB-Dry favored more by high minimum temperature and PB-Dry by high maximum temperature. Yield ranged between 4.20 and 7.94 t ha-1. Yield in PB-Dry was on average 0.35 to 0.50 t ha-1 lower than in the remaining ENV, but positive interactions between year and dry sowing systems were associated with high minimum temperatures at germination and tillering. N fertilization management affected wheat quality, but not wheat yield, possibly due to high levels of soil mineral N available at sowing that were not measured in this study. Split application of N increased grain N content compared to basal N application. Research should address reduced plant stands with dry sowing in conservation agriculture to find management options that improve wheat emergence. Further efforts to optimize N fertilizer management in PB are required to improve grain quality components. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Although kernel weight (KW) has proven to be an increasingly important driver behind grain yield (GY) variability in modern maize hybrids, nitrogen's (N) role in the determination of individual sink capacity (i.e., potential KW) during the lag phase of reproductive development remains unclear. The research objective was to study the relationships between endosperm cell number (ECN) during the lag phase (an indicator of potential KW) and final KW within the context of changing plant N dynamics in field-grown maize during the lag phase. Field experiments tested 3–4 N rates at different plant densities or N timing applications over a 3-year period (2017–2019). Kernels were removed from ears collected at 9, 10, 13, and/or 17 days after silking (DAS) and treated for ECN determination via tissue dissection, staining, enzymatic digestion, and digital microscopy. Plant growth rate, plant N uptake rate, ear growth rate, and ear N allocation rate during the lag phase were studied, as well as plant growth rate during the critical period and its relationship with kernel number per plant. Low N treatments consistently reduced ECN, thereby limiting KW during this early post-silking stage. Following data normalization, the majority of final KW variation was consistently explained by ECN across all experiments and relative DAS sampling times. Nitrogen rate effects on potential KW were not associated with plant growth rate per kernel during the critical period bracketing silking. ECN was highly correlated with ear N allocation rate during the lag phase, but not with plant N uptake rate during that period. Overall, these results show that higher N availability, independently of N timing and plant density, increased final KW by enhancing the sink capacity of individual kernels (at a wide range of kernel numbers per plant) via gains in ECN during lag-period development. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Yield gap (Yg) analysis is useful to map the scope for sustainable intensification of agriculture, but explaining and quantifying the underlying causes of yield gaps remains a considerable challenge. The objective of this study was to decompose maize yield gaps under different nitrogen (N) application rates and soil quality conditions across irrigated and rainfed cropping systems in China. A comprehensive database consisting of 5228 on-farm trials located in three major maize production regions of China was used for this purpose. The on-farm trials contained detailed information for four different treatments: fertilizer omission (control), optimal N rate (optimal N), 50% of optimal N rate (low N) and 150% of optimal N rate (high N). These were combined with biophysical and yield potential data from the Global Yield Gap Atlas (http://yieldgap.org). An analytical framework integrating stochastic frontier analysis and principles of production ecology was applied to decompose the overall maize yield gap into components of efficiency (and respective management and soil quality effects, Yg-M and Yg-S), resource (Yg-R), and technology Yg (Yg-T). The potential yield (Yp) of irrigated maize averaged 14.5 Mg/ha in Northeast China (NE) and 11.9 Mg/ha for North China Plain (NCP), and the water-limited potential yield (Yw) of rainfed maize averaged 12.0 Mg/ha in NE and 10.5 Mg/ha in Southwest China (SW), respectively. Maize yield gaps were highly variable across N treatments and cropping systems and ranged between 27–56% of Yp or Yw. Larger absolute yield gaps were observed in irrigated cropping systems in NE (4.8–8.1 Mg/ha) than in NCP (3.8–6.1 Mg/ha) and in rainfed cropping systems in NE (3.6–6.7 Mg/ha) and SW (2.8–5.9 Mg/ha). The components of the yield gap differed in size across cropping systems and N treatments. Yg-T was fairly small and consistent across N treatments ranging between 7.0% and 12.0% of Yp for irrigated maize and only ca. 2.0% of Yw for rainfed maize in NE. Yg-R was strongly associated with the N treatment explaining between 16.0–26.0% of Yp (or Yw) for control and low N treatments and being close to negligible for the optimal and high N treatments. Yg-M due to inefficient crop management accounted for 6.0–14.0% of Yp (or Yw) across cropping systems and N treatments, which is equivalent to 0.7–1.8 Mg/ha. The Yg-S explained the largest proportion of the total yield gap, especially in trials with low and medium soil quality levels, accounting for 11.0–24.0% of Yp or Yw (1.3–3.1 Mg/ha). The Yg-S was linked to partly manageable soil properties, such as low soil organic matter contents and low available P and/or K. This study is one of the first to incorporate the effects of soil quality in yield gap analysis and provides a basis to target management practices that can improve soil quality and N use efficiency while narrowing maize yield gaps in China. © 2021

AB  - Growing cover crops is one of the most promising conservation practices with multiple benefits. However, the impacts of cover crops on the productivity of the maize-soybean [Zea mays L. - Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation system in the U.S. Midwest still have large uncertainties based on results obtained from field experiments, specifically across different soil properties, climate conditions, and land management practices. Process-based models fully validated with data from field experiments across these diverse conditions provide an effective tool to quantify cover crop impacts on cash crop productivity and optimize the management of cover crops accordingly. In this study, we aim to answer the following questions: (1) What are the impacts of cover crops on cash crop yield in the U.S. Midwest agroecosystems? (2) What are the mechanistic pathways of cover crop to affect cash crop yield (e.g. through influencing soil water, nitrogen and O2 dynamics)? (3) What management practices can be used to mitigate the negative impacts on cash crop yield caused by cover crops? To address these questions, we calibrated and validated a sophisticated process-based agroecosystem model, ecosys, using field experimental data from 2013 to 2018 across Illinois, and then used ecosys to assess the impacts of winter cover crops on maize and soybean yield under different management practices. Our study revealed the following findings: (1) planting non-legume cover crops can cause 3.9 ± 3% yield reduction for maize and no significant impacts on soybean yield, while planting legume cover crops has no significant impact on the yield of either maize or soybean; (2) the maize yield reduction caused by planting cover crops can be mainly explained by nitrogen deficiency induced by increased immobilization, water competition in dry areas, cooler soil surface and oxygen competition; (3) later termination of non-legume cover crops before maize can result in larger maize yield loss due to intensive competition for resources (e.g. water and nitrogen), and the impacts of non-legume cover crops on maize yield reduction can be minimized by optimizing cover crop termination time in the spring. Overall, in the U.S. Midwestern maize-soybean rotation system, we found that although non-legume cover crops cause yield reduction for maize through resource competition, this yield reduction can be minimized through management practices, such as controlling termination time of cover crop and proper fertilizer management. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The benchmarking and monitoring of rice production performance indicators are essential for improving rice production self-sufficiency, increasing profitability, reducing labor requirements, optimizing fertilizer inputs, engaging youths in rice production, and increasing the overall sustainability of smallholder rice production systems in countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In this paper, we quantified five sustainability performance indicators (grain yield, net profit, labor productivity, and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) use efficiencies) to benchmark rice production systems in SSA. Data were collected between 2013–2014 from 2907 farmers from two rice production systems (irrigated and rainfed lowlands) across five agroecological zones (arid, semiarid, humid, subhumid and highlands) in 12 countries (Benin, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Madagascar, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania and Togo). The exploitable gap for each indicator (the difference between the mean of 10 % highest-yielding farms and the mean-yielding farms) was calculated across the countries, the two production systems and agroecological zones. The mean yield varied widely between 2.5 to 5.6 t ha−1 and 0.6 to 2.3 t ha−1 in irrigated and rainfed lowlands, respectively, with an average yield of 4.1 and 1.4 t ha−1, respectively. Across the country-production system combinations, there were yield gaps of 29–69 %, profit gaps of 10–89 %, and labor productivity gaps reaching 71 %. Yield, profit, and labor productivity were positively correlated. They were also positively correlated with N and P fertilizer application rate, but not with N and P use efficiencies. Only between 34–44 % of farmers had desirable ranges in N- or P-use efficiencies in the two production systems. All sites for rainfed lowlands were characterized by low-yield and large gaps in yield, profit, and labor productivity, whereas irrigated lowlands in some countries (Madagascar, Mali, and Togo) have similar characteristics as rainfed ones. We conclude that there is an urgent need to disseminate precision nutrient management practices for optimizing nutrient use efficiency and enhancing rice performance indicators especially in rainfed lowlands as well as low-yielding irrigated lowlands. Furthermore, we propose recommendations for specific categories (i.e. farmer, rice production system, agroecological zone and country) to close performance indicator gaps and to allow the production at scale to achieve rice self-sufficiency in SSA. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Despite the potential to increase soil organic matter, cycle soil nutrients, and suppress weeds, there is a concern that cover crops (CCs) soil water use negatively impacts subsequent crops in water-limited environments. Cover crop management practices such as planting and termination timing may mitigate the detrimental impacts of CCs in semi-arid cropping systems. To determine the effects of CCs under water-limited environments, we evaluated the total CC biomass produced in the fall and spring, soil water content during the subsequent maize growing season, weed density and biomass, crop residue, and soil nutrients at the maize V6 development stage, and maize productivity. The experiment was conducted under a wheat-maize-fallow rotation at two sites (Grant and North Platte, NE) during 2016−2017 and 2017−2018. Treatments consisted of three planting timings after winter wheat harvest and three CC termination timings and fallow (no CCs) before maize establishment. Planting CCs shortly after winter wheat harvest increased CC biomass in the fall and early spring compared to late planting. Cover crops terminated early in the spring reduced weed biomass (−70 %), while CCs terminated late in the spring reduced both weed density (−56 %) and biomass (−82 %) compared to fallow. Due to above-normal precipitation during the experiment, soil water measured at 0−20 cm soil depth was impacted by CCs only at Grant 2016−2017. Cover crops terminated late in the spring increased crop residue biomass but decreased total nitrogen at 0−10 cm soil depth by 17 %, and decreased soil nitrate at the 10−20 cm soil depth up to 26 % compared to fallow. Cover crops planted late in the summer (August) and terminated late in the spring (May) had the most detrimental impact on maize grain yield. Late termination of CCs in the spring reduced corn grain yield by up to 20 % compared to fallow. Despite enhanced weed suppression and crop residue, CCs decreased soil nitrogen and maize grain yield, especially when terminated late in the spring. Producers in semi-arid regions of the Great Plains willing to incorporate CCs should use caution when selecting management strategies for their CCs to minimize maize grain yield and economic losses. © 2021

AB  - In the wake of declining water availability for agricultural use that will severely disturb the cultivation of irrigated lowland rice (Oryza sativa), aerobic genotypes have been developed allowing rice to grow under drier conditions. However, canopy physiological and morphological characteristics associated with adaptation of aerobic rice to water-limited conditions have so far been understudied. Canopy architectural characters, light and nitrogen distribution parameters (i.e. the extinction coefficient for light, KL; and for nitrogen, KN; and their ratio KN:KL), plant growth and yield were examined in irrigated-lowland (cv. IR64) vs aerobic (cv. Apo) rice genotypes grown under three water regimes. Compared with cv. IR64, cv. Apo allocated less nitrogen to strongly shaded leaves, allowing the vertical nitrogen distribution to better acclimate to light distribution within the canopy. The KN:KL ratio increased with increasing water deficit, and cv. Apo (up to 49 % increase) had a higher increase than cv. IR64 (up to 24 % increase). This was attributed to the maintenance of erect leaves at the upper part of the canopy, allocation of less leaf area and less nitrogen to the shaded leaves under water deficit in cv. Apo. The observed differential response in the KN:KL ratio partly explained the difference in biomass gain and yield in response to water deficit between the two rice cultivars. We concluded that favourable above-ground architecture and canopy nitrogen profile relative to the light profile contributed greatly to the better performance of cv. Apo than cv. IR64 under dry conditions. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Inclusion of cover crops (CCs) in cropping systems can improve soil quality, reduce agricultural inputs, and improve environmental sustainability. While CCs have been widely promoted in China in recent years, a quantitative assessment of CC effect on crop yield across China is lacking. There is also no overarching analysis on factors explaining variation in yield effects. Here, we carried out a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of CCs on subsequent primary crop yield in China, based on 53 published studies reporting 442 yield ratios with and without CCs. We found that CCs increased subsequent primary crop yields by 9.7 % on average when compared with fallow across China. The effects of CC varied with different factors related to climatic zone, field management and soil properties. CC type (legume or not), CC season (growing in winter or summer) and nitrogen input were factors substantially influencing primary crop yield. We identified high yield benefits in subtropical rice systems with winter CCs (12.9 ± 3.9 %) but no significant yield benefits in temperate wheat systems with summer CCs (1.9 ± 6.6 %). Within subtropical rice systems, both legume and non-legume CCs were tested widely, and the effects of legume CCs (14.6 ± 4.0 %) on primary crop yield were greater than those of non-legume CCs (7.9 ± 3.7 %). The yield benefits of CCs decreased with increasing fertilizer inputs. These results may be used for developing policy recommendations to improve primary crop yield by integrating targeted CCs associated with nitrogen management into cropping systems in China. © 2021

AB  - Wheat efficiently remobilize and allocate a large fraction of aboveground biomass and nutrients into their grains during maturation. This senescence process has been streamlined through crop breeding, which lead to increasing harvest index (HI) for biomass. With field data from two ozone exposure experiments, we derived HI for 13 elements, both nutrients and non-essential, to determine how efficiently they are allocated into the wheat grain in two different agro-ecological environments (Sweden and China) and under different ozone exposure regimes. Element HI ranged from 10 to 90 %, with highest rates for P, N and Zn (90 %, 80 % and 70 %, respectively), while HI was low for the non-mobile elements Ba, Sr and Ca (<10 %). HI for biomass was about 50 %, and the non-essential and toxic element Cd was in the same range (∼40 %). Overall element HI was very similar in Chinese and Swedish wheat cultivars. This was also the case when comparing the two Chinese genotypes. We conclude that element HI for wheat crops are highly element specific and not strongly dependent on site or cultivar. Ozone exposure significantly reduced HI for both macronutrients (Ca, K, Mg, N, P) and micronutrients (Cu, Mn, Mo, Zn), but also for Cd, while there was no ozone effect on the total aboveground pool for any element except P and Ba. Consequently, the reduction in grain element yield induced by elevated ozone, observed in previous studies, can be explained by lower remobilization rates rather than reduced total uptake. Our results provide new insights of nutrient use efficiency in wheat crops in general and under ozone exposure, which can be implemented in crop modelling and also useful for breeding strategies aiming to improve the nutritional value of food crops. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Cover crop (CC) species selection can contribute to reducing soil penetration resistance (brassica species), improved soil nitrogen (N) cycling (legume species), and suppression of weeds (grass species). However, one of the main concerns about including CCs in water-limited environments is soil water use and the consequences to subsequent crops. To determine the effects of individual CC species under water-limited environments, we evaluated fall and spring CC biomass produced, and soil water and N content, penetration resistance, weed density and biomass during the maize growing season, and maize grain yield. The experiment was conducted under a winter wheat-maize-fallow rotation at two locations (North Platte and Grant, NE) during 2016−2017 and 2017−2018 (four site-years). Treatments consisted of seven popular CC species plus a control (fallow), planted after winter wheat harvest. Spring oats, Siberian kale, and purple top turnip produced greater fall biomass, while cereal rye produced the greatest amount of spring biomass. However, cereal rye reduced soil volumetric water content in North Platte 2016−2017 and increased soil penetration resistance from 20–30 cm soil depth across site-years likely due to soil water use. Spring cover crop growth suppressed weeds early in the maize growing season. Due to its aboveground biomass production, cereal rye decreased weed density and biomass by 80 and 88 %, respectively, compared to the fallow treatment. On the other hand, except for brassicas, CCs decreased N levels in the soil during maize growing season, and all CC species reduced maize grain yield up to 30 % compared to fallow (except spring oats). Spring oats can be an alternative to cereal rye as CC species for semi-arid regions. However, since CCs did not promote any maize yield gain, our findings suggest that producers should use caution when incorporating CCs in their cropping systems in water-limited environments. This research provides valuable information on the potential impact of CCs on rainfed maize production, as well as help producers and agronomists develop better CC management programs for cropping systems in semi-arid regions. © 2021

AB  - Straw incorporation and cover cropping are important measures for reducing loss of nitrate by leaching and supporting soil quality in cereal cropping systems. However, cereal straw also represents an important source of bioenergy, while concerns still exist regarding a negative effect of annual straw incorporation on crop yields. Based on a field experiment initiated in 1981 on a sandy loam soil at Askov Experimental Station (Denmark), we examined the effect of annual addition of straw (0, 4, 8 and 12 Mg ha−1), undersown cover crops (ryegrass and ryegrass-clover), and ploughing time (autumn and spring) on spring barley yields and N uptake in grain and grain-free aboveground biomass. During 1981–2019, grain yields showed an annual increase of 0.05 Mg DM ha−1 while grain N concentration decreased 0.019 %-point yr−1. Straw incorporation rate had a significant effect on grain yield in only six out of 31 years. The effect of increasing straw rates was slightly negative in two of the initial years but positive in the extreme drought year 2018. During 2004–2018, an undersown grass-clover cover crop increased grain yield with 0.41 Mg DM ha−1 and grain N concentration with 0.13 %-point, corresponding to relative increases of 9% when compared to no cover crop. In contrast, an undersown ryegrass cover crop reduced grain yield with 0.21 Mg DM ha−1 corresponding to a relative reduction of 5%, and increased grain N concentration with 0.03 %-point corresponding to a relative increase of 2%, as compared to no cover crop. The time of incorporating straw and cover crop residues had a minor effect on barley yield and quality. Our results suggest that removal of straw for bioenergy does not compromise yields of spring barley grown at this site, while an inclusion of undersown leguminous cover crops had a pronounced positive impact on crop yield and quality. However, implementation of these management measures needs to be site-specific and consider trade-offs between effects on crop yield and quality, environmental benefits, and soil quality. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Nitrogen (N) is an essential mineral nutrient for wheat grain yield and quality. Wheat cultivars with improved N-use efficiency (NUE, crop yield per unit availability of N from soil and fertiliser) have the potential to maximise farmers’ revenue and minimise environmental pollution risk. Thus, characterizing wheat cultivars for NUE traits is important for selection of cultivars better adapted to target production environments and for season-specific N fertiliser management. The aims of this study were to examine NUE traits in a set of modern winter wheat cultivars contrasting in phenology and grain-N content, and to assess the likely consequences of genotypic variation in N-related traits for adaptation of cultivars to specific environments. A two-year field experiment was conducted with four widely-grown commercial winter wheat cultivars (Arnold, Aurelius, Bernstein, Emilio) under four N application rates (0, 70, 140, 210 kg N ha−1) at the UFT (Universitäts- und Forschungszentrum Tulln, BOKU) in Austria. Detailed plant and soil data were collected to determine Green leaf area index (GLAI), total shoot dry mass (TDM) and N uptake (TNU) at anthesis and harvest, grain yield (GY), N harvest index (NHI), N remobilisation efficiency (NRE), and NUE. The experimental factors and variation in seasonal weather conditions resulted in a wide range of GY (268 −788 g m−2) and TNU (6.6-22.7 g m−2). With average values of 80 % for NHI and NRE, all cultivars were very efficient in the use of the accumulated N for producing GY. The observed significant differences in GY were largely due to differences in pre-anthesis N allocation to leaf and stem and post-anthesis DM production and N uptake, as cultivars had similar amounts of TDM and TNU at anthesis. The highest-yielding cultivar Aurelius showed consistently greater N uptake during grain filling. Cultivars also differed significantly in the partitioning of DM and N between leaf and stem in the pre-anthesis phase, with Bernstein showing the highest GLAI and leaf-N content in both experiments. The inter-seasonal variation in environmental conditions strongly influenced the performance and ranking of cultivars with regard to NUE traits and GY. The implications of genotypic variation in traits contributing to improved N use and their importance in better matching cultivar selection to target environments and N fertiliser management are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The development of cost-effective, digitally based decision support systems is a key challenge in the optimization of farm management. Yet, the majority of sensor-based decision tools which support fertiliser management have relied on simplistic mechanistic frameworks normally informed by a single sensor. This study used a 20-year nitrogen (N) experiment on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to test a range of approaches for N decision support systems, including commercial sensor-based options and a novel, multivariate, data-driven approach. The latter was based on a non-mechanistic framework in which various digital variables were trained directly against optimum N application rates using machine learning. It was hypothesized that such a method would enhance our ability to handle system complexity, resulting in higher accuracy for the decision, as compared to current farm management or to available sensor-based options, both of which are normally underpinned by mechanistic methods. Results showed that the proposed approach was able to predict the optimal N rate with an RMSE of 16.5 kg N ha–1 (R2 = 0.79). This method was also the only one that was statistically superior (p &lt; 0.05) to the control scenario (the application of the historical average optimal N rate; RMSE =38.0 kg N ha–1). This proposed approach used a multivariate digital input including a spectral vegetation index (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI), weather and soil moisture data and information from on-farm experimentation (the in-situ N response using a ‘N-rich’ strip) to guide the decision. When similar data input and modelling techniques were used to predict yield potential to then derive an N recommendation through a mechanistic decision framework – a nutrient mass balance – the recommendation error (RMSE) increased to 26.0 kg N ha−1 (R2 = 0.51). In summary, by forcing the input data through the mechanistic framework, the decision error increased. This study challenges the ideas that farm decisions should follow pre-established agronomic mechanistic frameworks and that digital technologies must necessarily be used to estimate specific crop and soil attributes so as to enable deployment of current decision systems at scale and site-specifically. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Intercropping cereals and legumes can increase agricultural productivity and reduce inputs of nitrogen fertilizer but there is a need for further literature synthesis on the size of intercropping advantages and the factors affecting these advantages. Here we present a global meta-analysis of 36 studies, 66 experiments and 260 treatments addressing the land productivity of maize (Zea mays L.) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) intercropping. Data were extracted from the literature and analyzed with mixed effects models to assess the land equivalent ratio (LER) and the factors affecting LER. The worldwide average LER of maize/peanut intercropping was 1.31 ± 0.03. The LER did not vary with continent, intercrop planting pattern and temporal niche differentiation, but sowing maize earlier than peanut (relative sowing time: RSTm<0) increased the partial LER of maize without significantly decreasing the partial LER of peanut. Increased N rate increased the partial LER of maize and decreased the partial LER of peanut but did not affect the total LER. This meta-analysis shows that maize/peanut intercropping is more land use efficient than the sole crops, it attains on average a “win-no win” yield advantage and mainly due to the maize. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - A stay-green phenotype is useful for adaptation of wheat to end-of-season drought conditions. We identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) for stay-green traits, as well as for height, days to anthesis and yield, in a multi-reference nested association mapping (MR-NAM) population of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in two environments differing in degree of drought stress experienced post-anthesis. The MR-NAM population consisted of three inter-related nested association mapping populations developed by nesting 11 diverse adaptation donors within three common reference parents, adapted to the northern, southern and western cropping regions of Australia, respectively. The construction of the MR-NAM population enables the assessment of the effect on a trait of multiple alleles at any particular locus, in different genetic backgrounds, and facilitates concurrent QTL mapping and germplasm development. This approach enabled identification of parent-specific alleles and context dependent expression. Using a new statistical method specifically developed to identify QTL in MR-NAM populations, we identified 65 QTL for stay-green traits. Co-location was observed between (i) trait by loci associations for some of the different stay-green traits, (ii) for QTL between the two environments, and (iii) between QTL for stay-green traits, plant height and grain yield. Some QTL co-located with those identified in other studies however, others are likely novel. Genetic markers associated with QTL for stay-green can be applied in breeding to enrich populations for stay-green traits in early generations of selection, prior to field testing in yield plots, in particular for the development of wheat cultivars targeted to end-of-season drought-stressed environments. This information is important for breeders, because it facilitates identification of the sources of the most promising alleles at particular loci for specific genetic backgrounds and growing environments. © 2021

AB  - Nitrogen (N) management is important for farmers to balance production, economic and environmental performance of their farms. This is particularly true in the intensive cropping systems of northwest Europe where tuber, root and bulb crops are cultivated in rotation with cereal crops and where an intensive livestock sector makes organic manures available at low cost for arable farmers. Here, we build upon a large database of farmer field data to assess mineral and organic fertiliser N performance, and its determinants, for the major arable crops in the Netherlands according to the guidelines provided by the EU N Expert Panel (EUNEP). The EUNEP framework quantifies N outputs and N inputs, N-use efficiency as the ratio between N outputs and N inputs (NUE in kg N output harvested per kg N input) and N surplus as the difference between N inputs and N outputs (Ns in kg N ha−1). As a next step, biophysical and crop management determinants of N performance were explored using data from different years, soil types and N management in relation to the amount, source, time and method of N applied. NUE was on average ca. 0.95 kg N kg−1 N for seed potato, sugar beet and spring onion, 0.87 kg N kg−1 N for ware potato, ca. 0.80 kg N kg−1 N for starch potato and winter wheat and, ca. 0.70 kg N kg−1 N for spring barley, all within or above the target range of 0.50–0.90 kg N kg−1 N proposed by the EUNEP. Ns was on average below the EUNEP threshold of 80 kg N ha−1 for all crops: 78 kg N ha−1 for ware potato and winter wheat, ca. 70 kg N ha−1 for starch potato, ca. 50 kg N ha−1 for spring barley, ca. 25 kg N ha−1 for sugar beet and spring onion and less than 20 kg N ha−1 for seed potato. Although average Ns was below 80 kg N ha−1, ca. 40% of the ware potato, starch potato and winter wheat fields analyzed had Ns above this threshold. The relatively high NUE combined with high Ns for most crops are the result of high N outputs (yields) combined with high N application rates. Moreover, high NUE and small Ns were mostly associated with smaller N application rates and with the use of mineral fertilisers instead of organic fertilisers, while there were no clear relationships between the two indicators on the one hand with N application time or method on the other. We conclude NUE and Ns were on average within the EUNEP target range for most crops, but there are still a considerable number of under-performing farms where increases in NUE and reductions in Ns are possible through reducing N inputs. We recommend future research to assess the benefits of organic fertilisers from a circularity perspective at regional and national levels and to cross-validate the crop-specific results presented in this study with NUE assessments at cropping systems level. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The application of crop models towards improved local scale prediction and precision management requires the identification and description of the major factors influencing model performance. Such efforts are particularly important for dryland areas which face rapid population growth and increasing constraints on water supplies. In this study, a global sensitivity analysis on crop yield and transpiration was performed for 49 parameters in the FAO-AquaCrop model (version 6.0) across three dryland farming areas with different climatic conditions. The Morris screening method and the variance-based Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (EFAST) method were used to evaluate the parameter sensitivities of several staple crops (maize, soybean or winter wheat) under dry, normal and wet scenarios. Results suggest that parameter sensitivities vary with the target model output (e.g., yield, transpiration) and the wetness condition. By synthesizing parameter sensitivities under different scenarios, the key parameters affecting model performance under both high and low water stress were identified for the three crops. Overall, factors relevant to root development tended to have large impacts under high water stress, while those controlling maximum canopy cover and senescence were more influential under low water stress. Parameter sensitivities were also shown to be stage-dependent from a day-by-day analysis of canopy cover and biomass simulations. Subsequent comparison with AquaCrop version 5.0 suggests that AquaCrop version 6.0 is less sensitive to uncertainties in soil properties. © 2021

AB  - Soil fertility depletion is a major constraint of smallholder farming in sub-Saharan Africa. We tested the aftereffects of green manures, namely vetch (Vicia sativa L.), lupin (Lupinus polyphyllus L.), and lablab (Lablab purpureus L.) incorporated into the soil compared to three fertilizer levels (0/0, 23/0, and 78/20 kg N/P ha−1) and evaluated their effect on soil fertility status and wheat yield in acidic Nitisols of southern Ethiopia, for three consecutive years (2017–2019). The treatments were laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. In 2017 and 2018, green manures were sown in March and April, respectively, using short rains and incorporated into the soil during late flowering stage, either (i) the whole shoot and root biomass were plowed under, (ii) shoot biomass was transferred to non-treated plots or (iii) only the below ground root biomass was used. Wheat was sown during long rains during the same growing season a month after the incorporation of green manures. In 2019, wheat was grown on the residual plots with the application of an additional 64/20 kg N/P ha−1. Results revealed that in 2017 and 2018 the application of vetch and lupin green manure resulted in grain yield advantages of 49 and 32 % and 34 and 19 %, respectively, over 0/0 and 23/0 kg N/P ha−1, though it produced less grain yield compared to higher fertilizer rates. In 2019, the addition of vetch and lupin whole biomass treatments gave significantly higher wheat yield over fertilizer treatments, with yield advantages of 18–26 %. Similarly, root biomass only also produced a significantly higher yield than fertilized plots. The yield benefits from green manures were due to improved soil water content, improved P-availability, significantly increased exchangeable K, Ca, and Mg, and increased pH by about 0.5 units. The residual effect of green manures could compensate for up to 33 % of the recommended rate of 78 N kg ha−1. We conclude that niche-based integration of green manures could improve yield, enhance soil carbon sequestration and sustain crop-livestock systems, whereby the above ground biomass could serve as quality livestock feed without compromising soil fertility benefits. © 2021

AB  - In the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains (EIGP), conventional rice-wheat system has led to a decline in productivity, input-use efficiency, and profitability. To address these, a four-year field study was conducted to evaluate the performance of tillage and crop establishment (TCE) methods in rice-wheat-greengram rotation. The treatments included: 1) random puddled transplanted rice (RPTR) - conventional-till broadcast wheat (BCW) - zero-till greengram (ZTG); 2) line PTR (LPTR) - conventional-till drill sown wheat (CTW) - ZTG; 3) machine transplanted rice in puddled soil (CTMTR) - zero tillage wheat (ZTW) - ZTG; 4) machine transplanted rice in zero-till wet soil (ZTMTR) - ZTW - ZTG; 5) system of rice intensification (SRI) - system of wheat intensification (SWI) - ZTG; 6) direct-seeded rice (DSR) - ZTW - ZTG; and 7) zero-till DSR - ZTW - ZTG. During the initial two years, conventional rice system (PTR) recorded a 16.2 % higher rice grain yield than DSR system. Whereas in the fourth year, the rice yields under DSR and PTR were comparable. As compared to SRI/SWI, the average wheat yield in ZT system was significantly high, whereas in rice, SRI/SWI system was comparable with CT system. ZTW after non-puddled rice was at par to CTW after PTR. The ZT wheat produced 4.6 % more yield than CT system. DSR production system consumed 6.8 % less water compared to transplanted system. On the system basis, 10.8 % higher net returns were recorded with CA-based system compared to conventional system. The system energy productivity under CA-based production system was 14–36 % higher than PTR-based systems. CA-based system also led to 8–10 % lower global warming potential (GWP) than conventional methods. The current study indicated that as compared to conventional system, a significant gain in productivity, profitability and energy-use efficiency, and reduction in the environmental mitigation are possible with emerging alternative TCE methods. Long-term expansion and further refinement of these technologies in local areas need to be explored for the second green revolution. © 2021

AB  - Quantifying maize root response to nitrogen (N) fertilizer, soil texture, and weather is crucial to understand complex soil-root-plant processes. We performed a 2-year x 4 locations (sand content range: 5–95%) x N treatments (range: 0 to 336 kg N ha−1) field experiment in Iowa, U.S. to (1) determine the response of root traits to N fertilizer, and (2) develop generalized functions to aid understanding and prediction of root mass and root to shoot (R:S) ratio. Deep root samples (0−210 cm, increments of 30 cm) were collected using the soil core approach at early to middle grain fill period and quantified root mass, length, and N and C concentrations. In addition, yield and shoot biomass was measured. Root traits and yield had different responses to N fertilizer input. Root mass was maximized at 168 kg N ha−1; zero and excessive N fertilization decreased root mass by 33 and 17 %, respectively. Nitrogen fertilizer significantly affected root traits only in the top 30 cm soil layer. Soil texture affected root traits in a dry year (root mass was positively associated with silt and clay), but not in a wet year, suggesting that soil moisture overwhelms the effect of texture. The combined data (N rates x locations x years) revealed a negative relationship between R:S ratio and yield. This resulted in a new set of equations (e.g., upper bound R:S = e(–1.5 – 0.04*yield)) that can replace the constant R:S approach used in the literature. Yield, which is commonly measured, integrates the effects of environment, management, and genetic variation; hence the proposed equations can be widely applied. This study provides evidence that different plant traits are maximized at different levels of mineral N nutrition. Results can enhance biophysical models and prediction of R:S ratio. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cereal-legume intercropping can increase yields, reduce fertilizer input and improve soil quality compared with pure culture. Designing intercropping systems requires the integration of plant species trait selection with choice of crop configuration and management. Crop growth models can facilitate the understanding and prediction of the interactions between plant traits, crop configuration and management. However, currently no existing crop growth model has been calibrated and tested for cereal-legume intercrops throughout Europea. We calibrated the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) for pure cultures of wheat and faba bean using data from Dutch field trials, and determined the phenological parameters to simulate pure cultures and intercrops from seven field experiments across Europe. APSIM successfully reproduced aboveground dry matters and, for wheat only, grain yields in pure cultures. In intercrops, APSIM systematically overestimated the aboveground dry matter and grain yield of faba bean and underestimated those of wheat. APSIM was reasonably capable of simulating plant heights in pure cultures, but respectively overestimated and underestimated the height of faba bean and wheat in intercrops. In order to simulate wheat-faba bean intercrops better, APSIM should be improved regarding the calculation of biomass partitioning to grains in faba bean and of height growth in both species. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Yam, a major food crop for West Africa, has not been managed to reach its potential productivity. The current practice of planting yam continuously for years after clear-cutting a field is not sustainable and has led to deforestation and nutrient depletion. By examining the effect of improved management on yam cultivation in Ghana, this study aimed to solve the tradeoff between improving yam yield and sustaining soil organic carbon (SOC). We used a calibrated and validated process-based crop simulation model, Systems Approach to Land Use Sustainability, to assess the impact of four management treatments: continuous unfertilized rainfed yam (control), pigeonpea-yam rotation, yam with 3 Mg/ha pigeonpea residue incorporated and yam with 23−23 N-P2O5 kg/ha fertilizer added. We modeled 10 years of yam yield and SOC across cropland in Ghana with varying levels of soil carbon, rainfall amount, and precipitation pattern. On average, simulated yam tuber yield was the highest with a pigeonpea residue incorporation treatment (4.1–11.9 Mg/ha, average of 7.5 Mg/ha). The rotation (average yield of 6.4 Mg/ha) and fertilizer (average of 7.0 Mg/ha) treatments produced comparable increases in yam yield over the control treatment (1.9–9.2 Mg/ha, average of 4.9 Mg/ha). The low yam yield of the control treatment was mostly attributed to nutrient deficiency (nitrogen and phosphorus). Drought also limited yam growth, particularly in northern Ghana. The three improved management treatments increased soil nutrient availability and thus improved yield. SOC declined under all four tested treatments over the simulated 10 years, but declined least with residue incorporation (average rate -0.3 Mg/ha/year), followed by fertilizer addition (-0.43 Mg/ha/year), rotation (-0.42 Mg/ha/year), and the control (-0.51 Mg/ha/year) management. Our work provides a benchmark for yam yield response to alternative management across Ghana, and highlights pigeonpea's contribution to sustainable intensification of yam. Further research is needed to untangle the interacting effects of land use and agronomic management on SOC. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Poor soil fertility and erratic rainfall constrain crop production in rain-fed smallholder farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Integration of drought tolerant and N2-fixing crops into maize-based cropping systems is a risk-averse strategy that also improves nitrogen cycling. A field experiment was carried out during the 2017/18 and 2018/19 cropping seasons in Goromonzi district in Zimbabwe. The trials were established on 14 farms, and on two field types (homefields and outfields), with eight treatments from a combination of cropping systems (maize and cowpea monocrops or maize/cowpea intercrops) and with or without nitrogen fertilizer (+N; -N). The trials were implemented on the same field plots for the two consecutive seasons. An improved cowpea variety and a landrace were used. The objectives were to determine 1) the productivity of the different cropping systems under variable soil fertility conditions, 2) N2-fixation of the two cowpea types when planted as monocrops or intercrops, and 3) mineral composition of maize and cowpea grains from intercrops and sole crops. Contrary to expected results, soil properties were not significantly different (P &gt; 0.05) between field types. The land equivalent ratios (LER) were &gt;1 for both seasons, implying improved land productivity under intercropping. Intercropping significantly reduced cowpea nodulation and active nodules, but not the total nodule weight, resulting in similar proportion of nitrogen derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa) for cowpea grown as monocrop or in intercropping with maize. However, the total amount of fixed nitrogen was reduced in intercropping systems due to the smaller cowpea biomass compared to monocropping. Maize and cowpea grain mineral contents (Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Ca, Mg, P, K) were significantly affected by the cropping season only. We showed that intercropping maize with cowpea generally increases system productivity, in addition to substantial amounts of nitrogen being added to the system through N2-fixation. However, intercropping was not an agronomic biofortification option in these nutrient-depleted soils. Finally, annual variation in grain mineral quality can be larger than the annual variation in grain yield, potentially posing serious challenges to human nutrition. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is a legume crop widely cultivated across the Sudan Savanna. Despite its importance for farmers’ food security in this region, the grain yields are highly variable among years and locations. To identify environmental and plant factors underlying this yield variation and select cowpeas with a stable yield, the grain yield variation of 16 cowpea genotypes in three dominant soils in the Sudan Savanna, namely, Ferric Lixisols (LXfr), Petric Plinthosols (PTpt), and Pisoplinthic Petric Plinthosols (PTpt.px), were analyzed in two consecutive years with different precipitation. In this study, the three soils were located near each other at the experimental site and thus the meteorological conditions were assumed to be identical for the soil types. Results of analysis of variance showed that the factor of year, representing the effect of precipitation, was the largest cause of annual yield variation although there was a significant interaction between year and soil type. Based on this result, environment was defined as each combination of year and soil type in a subsequent additive main effect and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model analysis to detect the effects of the environment, genotype, and genotype-environmental interaction (GEI) on grain yield variation. Then, additive Bayesian network (ABN) analysis was performed to investigate the relationships between environmental and plant factors. The AMMI model revealed that the effect of GEI on grain yield was the complete opposite between the years even for the same soil type, indicating no single genotype achieved both stable and high yields across these soil types. The ABN analysis suggested that the primary cause of yield variation among the different soil types under same precipitation was the difference in soil total nitrogen and available phosphorus content rather than that in available soil water. The larger GEI in LXfr and PTpt was caused partly by their high water holding capacity, which led to excess water stress under high precipitation for LXfr and PTpt, and partly by deep soils, which led to drought stress under low precipitation for LXfr because of infiltration into the subsurface layer. However, the higher fertility of these two soils compensated for excess water/drought stress, and thus, the average yields were higher than that in PTpt.p × . PTpt.px showed the lowest mean yield and the smallest GEI because of poor soil fertility, although the soil with low water holding capacity was prone to drought stress even during short dry spells. The AMMI model uncovered two cowpea genotypes with stable yield across all the environments; however, the grain yields of these genotypes were not the highest in each environment. Selection of a genotype with a medium but stable yield would be favorable to improve long-term average yield in the Sudan Savanna, where multiple soils with a large GEI are distributed in mosaic patterns. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Eco-efficient use of nitrogen (N) fertilizer in Corn (Zea Mays L.) requires timely information about the supply of N from the soil and the response to N by the crop. These are complex processes, and multiple N management strategies (NMS) have been proposed over time. In this work, we used APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) to simulate the response of Corn's Yield to N for ca. 4200 fields in the state of Illinois in different weather scenarios. Ten different N management strategies were evaluated using environmental and economic indicators. They were created by combining different sources of trial data, different types of prediction models, different predictor variables measured on the fields, and different technologies to apply fertilizer in the field. This study provides knowledge that is unattainable through field experimentation, leveraging current knowledge on the mechanisms that drive the yield response to N to help farmers, researchers, and policymakers to select strategies in line with their objectives. Our results showed that an N management strategy that incorporates year-to-year variability in the predictions and uses data from trials spread in the region achieved the highest eco-efficiency. Such strategy would reduce the mean N-leaching by 12.7% without changing profits compared with the N management strategy most used by extension services in the area. Nitrogen measurements obtained by soil sampling were the most important predictor and could not be replaced by other less laborious variables. Variable-rate technology did not provide significant economic or environmental value in the area. © 2020 The Author

AB  - Smallholder farmers face many constraints to achieving food security. Optimal soil management is often limited by a lack of accessible and accurate soil characterization, and an associated lack of soil-specific management practice recommendations. Crop yields depend on both soil quality and soil-mediated fertilizer responses. Existing research on soil-fertilizer interactions is primarily based on farm trials and/or survey data, which are resource intensive and typically restricted to local scales. High-resolution (∼10-meter) remote sensing data and digital soil maps provide a low cost, scalable alternative. Here, we deploy methods based on the Sentinel satellite constellation to estimate soil and fertilizer impacts on irrigated wheat grain yields in Nepal and to inform precision soil and nutrient management recommendations. We first combine field data with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery to delineate wheat cropping areas for 2016–2019 with 92 % accuracy. We then estimate wheat yields at 10-meter resolution using Sentinel-2 and weather covariates based on yield models parameterized from two different methods: 1) APSIM crop model simulations and 2) ground cropcuts from 147 fields. Using a large dataset of soil samples collected by the Nepal Agricultural Research Council, we examine the linear and non-linear effects of soil properties on wheat yields. Finally, the soil maps were combined with a survey of field-level crop management data and our yield estimates to test the interaction of soil quality with fertilizer effectiveness. Our ground-calibrated satellite model predicted yields with good accuracy (R2 = 0.55), while the uncalibrated simulation-based approach had weaker but significant prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.24). We find statistically significant gains in yield of 0.9–2.4 % are possible by increasing soil organic matter and zinc from highly deficient values to optimal values of 2.2 % organic matter (OM) and 0.67 ppm zinc (Zn). Using digital soil maps of Nepal produced by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), we map croplands deficient in zinc (Zn &lt; 0.66 ppm) and organic matter (OM &lt; 2.2 %) and find that 72 % of croplands in the Nepal Terai are experiencing less than optimal levels of these nutrients. We examine the effectiveness of nitrogen and zinc fertilizers, applied in amounts ranging from 0 to 150 kg ha−1 and 0 to 15 kg ha−1 respectively, in different soil quality regimes as determined by a soil quality index informed by standard relationships between crop yields and soil properties. Yields were significantly more responsive to zinc fertilizer inputs in soils with a higher than average soil quality but responded similarly to nitrogen inputs across different soils. Effects of soil and fertilizers on the simulation-based yield estimate were generally similar but less significant than effects on ground-calibrated yields. Overall, nitrogen and zinc increased ground-calibrated yields by 0.8 and 10.4 kg ha−1 per kg of nutrient input, respectively. This research demonstrates the potential of satellite data, crop simulation, and machine learning to examine the influence of soils on yields and guide precision fertilizer use in smallholder regions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Low soil fertility, soil water stress and deteriorating natural resources are among the causal factors to low crop productivity in Africa. In this study, impact of cropping systems and water management practices on yield of different crops were simulated using the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer-Cropping System Model. The treatments included continuous cropping (monoculture) of three different crops [wheat, WT; barley, BA; chickpea, CP]; and rotation systems (WT-BA, and WT-BA-CP). Crops were treated with three different water management practices (a) rainfed; (b) tied ridging; and (c) irrigation. Five years (2013−2017) average actual yields were obtained and average short-term (2013−2017) and long-term (1984−2019) yield gaps, relative yields and yield changes were calculated. The yield gap (Yg) [the difference between actual (Ya) and simulated rainfed yield (Yw)] for wheat, barley and chickpea were 0.0 to 0.6, 0.1 to 1.7 and 0.2 to 2.1 Mg/ha, respectively. The large Yg value for chickpea was mainly attributed to the water stress. Whereas barley and wheat yield were less affected by the water stress when compared to chickpea. The rotation WT-BA-CP was more responsive to water management than WT-BA. Tied ridging or irrigations can be considered as an option for improving yield in water scarce areas. Chickpea fixed substantial amount of nitrogen (90–246 kg N/ha) in the soil, which could result in yield benefits and reduced use of inorganic nitrogen. Overall, the rotation WT-BA-CP may be a better option than WT-BA or continuous cropping as it can provide multiple benefits via enhanced crop diversity, improved soil fertility and more resilience to pest and diseases. This simulation case study and discussion of results showed the importance of integration of crop rotations with soil and water conservation practices for improving overall yields and contributions to ecological intensification. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Breeding to raise yield potential through enhancing photosynthesis will have limited impact unless harvest index (HI: proportion of above-ground biomass as grain yield) is maintained or ideally increased. Boosting grain dry matter (DM) partitioning will require increased allocation of assimilates to sink organs to enhance spike growth. A high biomass spring wheat panel of 150 genotypes encompassing elite, landrace-derived and synthetic-derived lines was grown under yield potential conditions in two seasons in NW Mexico. Results showed that the incorporation of landrace-derived and synthetic-derived backgrounds into elite lines resulted in higher expression of above-ground biomass (AGDM), leaf lamina and stem DM partitioning at anthesis. However, no grain yield advantage was observed over elite lines, due to lower grain number per unit area (GN) and decreased harvest index (HI). Positive linear associations were found among spike fertility-related traits - fruiting efficiency (grains per unit of spike DM at anthesis; FE), GN and HI - which were, in turn, related positively with grain yield (GY). Stem-internode 3 length and internode 3 DM partioning were negatively associated with spike partitioning index (SPI: ratio of spike DM to total above-ground DM at anthesis) and GN, suggesting an enhanced competition for assimilates between the spike and stem internode 3 during stem elongation. Within-spike DM partitioning analysis (glume, lemma, palea, rachis, awn) showed decreased partitioning to awns was associated with increased FE and thousand grain weight (TGW). While the use of exotic material can enhance biomass, special attention needs to be paid in the selection for novel DM partitioning traits that raise HI and GN coming from the elite genepool. The selection for grain partitioning traits in wheat breeding combined with sources expressing high biomass can potentially allow breeders to increase grain carbon assimilation that will deliver higher yields. © 2020

AB  - Climate change could undermine grain legumes ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen and their contribution to increase cropping systems sustainability. Pea (Pisum sativum L.) and faba bean (Vicia faba L.) are the two most widely grown grain legumes in Europe, yet the potential impact of climate change on their performances has not been quantified. We calibrated and evaluated the STICS soil-crop model for spring pea, winter pea and winter faba bean using experimental data from southwestern France and explored the effect of contrasting climate change scenarios. After calibration, STICS accurately simulated grain yield and amount of N2 fixed for the experimental growing seasons. Assuming no change in crop management, mean and inter-annual variability of grain yield and fixed N2 were assessed for historical (1995−2015), mid-term (2020−2040) and long-term (2060−2080) periods in one location in southwestern France. We considered projections from three climate models and two Representative [CO2] Pathways (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). The climate models spanned a wide range of changes in temperature (+0.3 to +4.1 °C) and rainfall (−15% to +8%) depending on time horizon and RCP. Simulated grain yield increased over the long term in most scenarios (+1 to +25%), and spring pea tended to benefit less than winter pea and winter faba bean. Nevertheless, for the climate scenario with a decrease in rainfall and the strongest increase in temperature, simulated spring pea grain yield decreased by 28% while winter legumes yields were less affected (−14% for pea and no decrease for faba bean). Simulated changes in the amount of N2 fixed followed the grain yield response. Temperature rise caused a shortening in crop cycle duration. Simulated temperature stress significantly increased for spring and winter pea in most climate change scenarios while winter faba bean was rather unaffected due to greater upper temperature thresholds. N2 fixation of spring pea was reduced by above-optimal temperature during its vegetative growth in spring while N2 fixation of winter legumes was enhanced by the increase in temperature during their vegetative growth in winter. Simulated drought stress only increased in the climate scenario predicting a decrease in rainfall. Overall, [CO2] increase would allow offsetting negative effects of temperature and drought on grain yield and N2 fixation, except for climate scenarios involving a decrease in rainfall and the strong increase in temperature. The contrasted simulated response of winter and spring grain legumes to climate change in southwestern France points to the opportunity to tap grain legume diversity and cultivar choice as an adaptation strategy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Durum wheat is one of the most important crops in the Mediterranean basin. The choice of the cultivar and the sowing time are key management practices that ensure high yield. Crop simulation models could be used to investigate the genotype × environment × sowing window (G × E×SW) interactions in order to optimize farmers’ actions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the wheat model SiriusQuality in simulating durum wheat yields in Mediterranean environments and its potential to explore the G × E×SW interactions. SiriusQuality was assessed in multiple growing seasons at seven sites located in Italy, Spain and Morocco, where locally adapted cultivars were grown. The model showed good ability in predicting anthesis and maturity date (Pearson r >0.8), as well as above ground biomass and grain yield (6 % < nRMSE < 18 %). The model was then used to find the optimal 30-day sowing window to maximize grain yields at four sites, two were located in Italy (Florence, Foggia), and the other two were in Spain (Santaella) and Morocco (Sidi El Aydi) respectively. Among the cultivars, on the average between all sowing window, Amilcar had the best performance in Foggia (+33 % compared to the traditional cultivar Simeto) and in Sidi El Aydi (+22 % compared to Karim), Karim in Florence (+19 % compared to Creso) and in Santaella (+6 % compared to Amilcar). Instead Creso and Simeto showed the lowest production at all locations. The results showed that an earlier sowing window compared to the traditional one would have a positive effect on wheat yields in all environments tested, because of increased maximum leaf area index, grain number and size, and grain filling duration. Moreover, with earlier sowing, grain filling coincides with higher soil water availability, reducing the water stress and increasing the accumulation of dry mass in grains. In cooler and wetter locations, cultivars characterized by higher leaf area index and radiation use efficiency had the higher number of grains, while in the hottest and driest locations, short-cycle cultivars with high grain dry matter potential (e.g. through enhanced “stay green” capacity) should be preferred. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Soybean is prone to weed infestations and yield variability. With the proposition of using intercropping to overcome these problems, this study explored the effects of combinations of different associated crop species and spatial arrangements on grain production and weed control. In a two-year field experiment in western France, soybean was intercropped with buckwheat, lentil, sorghum and sunflower in two spatial arrangements: within-row intercropping and alternate-row intercropping, to investigate their effects on weed control and soybean production. The results showed that the highest soybean yield occurred in the intercropping with lentil, followed by sorghum and sunflower, and finally buckwheat, but this effect varied by year. The opposite species order was obtained for weed control, revealing a trade-off between soybean production and weed control. We also demonstrated that associated species height was related to soybean yield and weed control. Alternate-row intercropping helped to increase soybean production without compromising weed control for sorghum and buckwheat, which have small height difference with soybean. Finally, our paper showed that combining associated species choice and spatial arrangement allows farmers to manage the trade-off between soybean yield and weed control. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In a previous paper (Field Crops Res. 203, 114–127), we showed that the difference in yield potential between a contemporary and a traditional cultivar was due to differences in fruiting efficiency, likely derived from differences in spike fertility (fertile florets per spike) while having similar spike dry weights at anthesis. In this study, we determined the mechanistic bases of these genotypic differences in spike fertility analysing the initiation of all floret primordia per spike (up to 8), the maximum number of florets initiated per spikelet, and the associated floret developmental rates and their fate to become fertile florets under contrasting photoperiod (natural vs extended) and nitrogen availability (50 or 200 kg N ha−1) during the stem elongation phase. Under potential growing conditions (natural photoperiod, high nitrogen availability), the contemporary cultivar owed its higher spike fertility to the improved rate of floret development, which mainly determined an improved level of floret primordia survival to produce fertile florets. The sensitivity of the floret developmental patterns to faster development due to exposure to an extended photoperiod and, to a larger extent, a reduction in N availability was similar for both cultivars, providing a basis for the consistent differences in spike fertility across a range of environments. The response again determined a main effect through increasing floret mortality reducing therefore the level of fertile florets per spikelet in these conditions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Diversified grain crop rotations have shown yield advantages, but it is unclear if this is related to improved N supply. Crop residue-N supply could be an important driver of differences observed in contrasting crop rotations. To address this, we focused on a long-term field trial near Guelph Ontario that compares different grain crop rotations and tillage practices. We hypothesized that diversified crop rotations increase the transfer of residue-derived N to subsequent crops. From 2017 to 2018, we used a 15N technique to measure N turnover in a simple corn and soybean rotation compared to a diversified rotation where winter wheat and red clover were included. Although crop yields were greater in the diverse vs. simple rotation, the long-term rotation had no impact on crop residue N turnover to the subsequent crop—a finding that did not support our hypothesis. The recovery of above- plus below-ground residual-N by the subsequent crops varied by crop type and sequence: 9.7–13.5% of corn residue-N was recovered in the soybean seed, 26 % of soybean residue-N was recovered in the corn grain, and 30 % of winter wheat/red clover residue-N was recovered in the corn grain. Below-ground residue-N recoveries in subsequent grain or seed were 4- to 10-times greater than above-ground residues; in terms of the total contribution, below-ground residue-N supplied 8- to 18-times more N than above-ground residues. Indigenous soil N or fixed N were principal contributors to crop N uptake; more so than the crop residues or fertilizer combined. At this site, an accumulated legacy of N fertilizer applications is likely responsible for building a soil N reservoir for crop production, explaining yield benefits observed by diversifying the rotation—but also masking any effect that diversification may have on residue-N turnover and subsequent crop N uptake. To improve N use efficiency, diversifying crop rotations should be accompanied with reduced N fertilizer applications, and better account for below-ground residual N pools as well as legume N inputs. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Future increases in yield potential will rely largely on improved photosynthesis. Whereas emphasis has traditionally been given to measuring leaf photosynthesis, wheat spikes have an important role in filling grains since they can intercept up to a third of incident light. In the present study, 196 genetically diverse spring wheat lines were evaluated for spike photosynthesis (SP) under temperate (yield potential) and heat stressed, irrigated conditions. Two different methods to estimate SP were used: (i) gas exchange measurements of SP rate and (ii) integrative measurements using a SP inhibition treatment (consisting of a permeable textile covering the spikes). Rate of SP was measured directly in 45 selected genotypes under yield potential conditions using a custom-made illuminating chamber. In these lines, a variation of 2.8-fold for spike photosynthetic rate is reported for the first time with good heritability estimates. Correlations between SP rate and yield, thousand grain weight, number of grains per spike and radiation use efficiency are reported across different panels. Genotypic variation in SP was independent from flag leaf photosynthesis suggesting that any strategy aiming to increase canopy photosynthesis should also consider SP. The SP inhibition treatments were applied on the 196 lines in both environments to estimate SP contribution to grain weight per spike, which was 30–40 % under both heat stressed and yield potential conditions averaged across lines. Positive correlations with grain yield were observed for spike photosynthesis contribution across all of the panels under heat stress and when combining heat and yield potential environments (P < 0.001, r = 0.401). These results indicate a highly significant genotypic variation of spike photosynthetic rate and spike photosynthesis contribution to grain yield among wheat lines and highlight its importance under irrigated and heat stressed conditions. © 2020

AB  - Yield gaps and water productivity are key indicators to monitor the progress towards more sustainable and productive cropping systems. Individual farmers are collecting increasing amounts of data (‘big data’), which can help monitor the process of sustainable intensification at local level. In this study, we build upon such data to quantify the magnitude and identify the biophysical and management determinants of on-farm yield gaps and water productivity for the main arable crops cultivated in the Netherlands. The analysis focused on ware, seed and starch potatoes, sugar beet, spring onion, winter wheat and spring barley and covered the period 2015–2017. A crop modelling approach based on crop coefficients (kc) and daily weather data was used to estimate the potential yield (Yp), radiation intercepted and potential evapotranspiration (ETP) for each crop. Yield gaps were estimated to be ca. 10% of Yp for sugar beet, 25–30% of Yp for ware, seed and starch potato and spring barley, and 35–40% of Yp for spring onion and winter wheat. Variation in actual yields was associated with water availability in key periods of the growing season as well as with sowing and harvest dates. However, the R2 of the fitted regressions was rather low (20–49%). Current levels of crop water productivity ranged between 13 kg DM ha−1 mm−1 for spring barley, ca. 15 kg DM ha−1 mm−1 for seed potato, spring onion and winter wheat, 23 kg DM ha−1 mm−1 for ware potato and ca. 25 kg DM ha−1 mm−1 for starch potato and sugar beet. These values are about half of their potential, but increasing actual water productivity further is restricted by rainfall amount and distribution. However, doing so should not be prioritized over reducing environmental impacts of these intensive cropping systems in the short-term and may require large investments from farm to regional levels in the long-term. Although these findings are most relevant to similar cropping systems in NW Europe, the underlying methods are generic and can be used to benchmark crop performance in other cropping systems. Based on this work, we argue that ‘big data’ are currently most useful to describe cropping systems at regional scale and derive benchmarks of farm performance but not as much to predict and explain crop yield variability in time and space. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - There is a well-established negative relationship between the yield and the concentration of protein in the mature wheat grain. However, some wheat genotypes consistently deviate from this relationship, a phenomenon known as Grain Protein Deviation (GPD). Positive GPD is therefore of considerable interest in relation to reducing the requirement for nitrogen fertilization for producing wheat for breadmaking. We have carried out two sets of field experiments on multiple sites in South East England. The first set comprised 11 field trials of 6 cultivars grown over three years (2008–2011) and the second comprised 9 field trials of 40 genotypes grown over two years (2015–2017) and 5 field trials of 30 genotypes grown in a single year (2017–2018). All trials comprised three replicate randomized plots of each genotype and nutrient regime. These studies showed strong genetic variation in GPD, which also differed in stability between genotypes, with cultivars bred in the UK generally having higher GPD and higher stability than those bred in other European countries. The heritability of GPD was estimated as 0.44, based on data from the field trials of 30 and 40 genotypes. The largest component contributing to the genetic variance was genotype (0.30), with a smaller contribution of the interaction between genotype and year/site (0.11) and a small (but statistically significant) contribution of nitrogen level. These studies suggest that selection for GPD is a viable target for breeders. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - For the first time, this research enables a systematic parametric analysis of oat lodging to be undertaken. A generalised lodging model combining agronomy, biology and wind engineering has been used. Standard husbandry treatments have been deployed in order to ensure that the oat plants are grown in realistic conditions and to ensure that the results are widely applicable. It is shown that the drag area, which increases through the growing season as the oats become entangled, is the plant trait which influences both stem and root lodging the most. In addition (and consistent with other plants) stem yield stress and the number of stems per plant for stem lodging and the diameter of the root structure in the case of root lodging, are found to play an important role. It is also shown that there is a linear relationship between failure anchorage moment and the cube of the root diameter in oats. Moreover, monitoring the lodging in crops which were grown under different husbandry treatments revealed using a resistant variety coupled with low Nitrogen rates and low seed rates, whilst also applying a Plant Growth Regulator (PGR) can increase the resistance of oat against lodging. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Crop production in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is constrained by rainfall variability and declining soil fertility. This has over time led to a decrease in crop yield, among them also maize. This decrease is also experienced in the sub-humid and semi-arid locations of Kenya. Among the commonly used soil and water management practices in SSA are Conservation Agriculture (CA) and integrated soil fertility management (ISFM). Crop response to these management practices is influenced by the existence of soil fertility gradients which are common among smallholder farmers. This paper presents results from a study done in the sub-humid and semi-arid location of Kenya, focusing on the effects of CA- and/or ISFM-based practices on maize yield. Trials were set out on farms within the two locations using a one farm one replicate randomized design. In each farm, CA-based treatment, no tillage with residue retention (NTR), ISFM-based treatment, conventional tillage with use of manure (CTM), a combination of CA + ISFM, no tillage with residue retention and use of manure (NTRM) and a control, (C) were laid down on fields representing high and low fertility soils. The trials started in the long rains of 2017 (LR2017) running for four seasons i.e., LR2017, short rains 2017 (SR2017), long rains 2018 (LR2018) and short rains 2018 (SR2018). Soil water content (SWC) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) were also monitored and evaluated. In either high or low fertility fields, maize grain yield was significantly different between the control and both NTR, CTM and NTRM with no significant differences between NTR, CTM and NTRM. Maize grain yield increase compared to the control was highest under ISFM in the low fertility fields in both locations and all seasons. For example, during the last season, SR2018, NTR, CTM and NTRM significantly increased maize grain yield by 136 %, 297 %, and 208 %, respectively, compared to the control, in the low fertility fields of sub-humid Kibugu. In the semi-arid Machang'a, the increase by NTR, CTM and NTRM, respectively, in the low fertility fields was 146 %, 379 % and 183 % for SR2018. This was linked to the tendency of ISFM to improve crop yield in the short run. For both locations, SWC and NUE were highest under NTR. In the sub-humid Kibugu, during SR2018, at the grain filling stage, 78 days after sowing, SWC under NTR, CTM and NTRM was higher by 16 %, 9 % and 20 %, respectively, compared to the control. Also at 78 days after sowing, in the semi-arid Machang'a, SWC was 18 %, 7 % and 15 % significantly higher under NTR, CTM and NTRM, respectively, compared to the control. The higher SWC observed under NTR and NTRM was related to no tillage with residue retention while under CTM it was related to improved soil organic matter through manure addition. NUE, on the other hand, was 26 % and 23 % in Kibugu and Machang'a, respectively, and lowest under the combined practice (NTRM), i.e., 19 % and 15 % in Kibugu and Machang'a, respectively. The high NUE under CA was attributed to the placement of urea in the planting holes while maintaining residue on the soil surface. The low NUE under NTRM was linked to fertilizer N immobilization. Lastly, from the biomass yield, our study showed that monocrop maize under NTR requires a kick-starting by an ISFM-based practice in the low fertility fields of the semi-arid region. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The introgression of awns as a source of photoassimilates during grain filling has received has long been of particular attention in wheat. Although the benefits for average grain weight (AGW) seem consistent, those for yield still remain unclear, and the causes for the improved AGW have not been examined. In this study we carried out three field experiments. In two of them, one in CIMMYT (Mexico) and the other in Lleida (Spain), we compared awned-awnless near isogenic lines (NILs) subjected to defoliation and degraining during the effective period of grain filling, whilst in another experiment we analysed the responses of modern cultivars to awn detachment 10 days after anthesis under two nitrogen levels. There were not consistent differences in yield between the awned-awnless NILs neither across the locations nor across genetic backgrounds. This lack of effect on yield was associated with a compensatory effect of the presence of awns on decreasing grain number while increasing AGW. The manipulation treatments did not consistently affect AGW neither in the NILs nor in the modern cultivars. Focusing on the responses of the NILs, firstly there were some statistically significant responses in AGW but they were both mostly very small and inconsistent between defoliation and degraining treatments as well as between genetic backgrounds. Secondly these responses failed to be consistently more noticeable in the awnless than in the awned lines (as expected if the presence of awns increases AGW through increasing photosynthetic capacity during grain filling). The increase on AGW due to the presence of awns seemed ascribed to both an indirect and a direct effect. The former would simply reflect the consequence of awns reducing grain number: this would naturally be the consequence of an increased failure of distal florets to become fertile which would have reduced the proportion of grains constitutively smaller as well. A direct true effect on the capacity of the grains to grow also emerged with the analysis of individual size of each particular grain for the awned-awnless NILs revealing a constitutively higher potential size in the awned NILs, even for the largest grains. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - It has been frequently suggested that varieties bred/selected under conventional farming conditions lack important traits required for optimum performance under low agrochemical input conditions. However, there is limited scientific information about interactions between cultivars bred/selected for the low input vs conventional farming sector and innovative crop agronomic strategies on crop health, yield and quality parameters to support this hypothesis. The main objective of this pilot study was therefore to compare the effect of contrasting fertilisation and crop protection regimes used in organic and conventional farming on crop health and performance parameter in two wheat varieties developed for organic/low input and conventional farming systems respectively. Results indicate that both leaf phenolic and flavonoid compounds, were positively associated with use of the ‘long straw’ variety Aszita and to a lesser extent composted FYM fertiliser inputs, while they were negatively associated with mineral N-fertiliser inputs, plant N uptake and use of the ‘short straw’ variety Solstice. On the other hand foliar and ear disease severity were positively associated with plant N uptake, use of the variety Solstice and the use of mineral fertilisers, while they were negatively associated with composted FYM fertiliser inputs, leaf phenolic/flavonoid concentrations and the use of the variety Aszita. Overall findings suggest that low input farming-focused breeding programmes might deliver varieties such as Aszita that have lower yield potential, but have higher grain protein, leaf phenolic concentrations, and foliar disease resistance under low-input conditions. Future studies should investigate whether the higher foliar phenolic levels found in low input varieties are linked to disease resistance and if they are also expressed in the grain. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - A lack of plant available water limits the ability to intensify the summer fallow-winter wheat (SF-WW) rotation in low precipitation (&lt;350 mm) areas of the inland Pacific Northwest (PNW). The objective of this study was to compare crop yield, water use efficiency, precipitation capture, and soil water storage between conventional-tillage SF and reduced tillage fallow (RTF) and among different 2-yr and 3-yr cropping sequences. After full initiation of the experiment, eight sequences were evaluated over a 3-yr period (2016−18) including SF-WW, RTF-WW, RTF-WW-spring barley (SB), RTF-winter napus canola (WN)-spring wheat (SW), RTF-spring carinata (SC)-SW, RTF-WN-spring forage triticale (ST), and RTF-winter forage triticale (WT)-SC. Growing season precipitation was near average (269 mm) each year. Ponded infiltration rates were significantly higher (P ≤ 0.05) in 2-yr rotations managed with RTF (77.68 ± 24.56 mm h−1) than SF (37.08 ± 13.03 mm h−1). Water use efficiency and yields of WW were generally greater following RTF than for WW after SF. Water use and yield of winter cereals WW and WT after fallow were greater than for oilseeds WN and SC that also followed fallow. Pre-plant soil water contents were significantly lower following a primary crop than after fallow. Consequently, water use and yield of secondary crops were &lt;50 % of primary crops. Of 3-yr cropping sequences, RTF-WW-SB and RTF-WW-SC had the highest water use efficiencies with annualized yields generally approaching that of RTF-WW and SF-WW. These results support integration of spring barley and spring carinata under low precipitation dryland conditions in the PNW to increase diversification and improve conservation of water. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nutrient management of cassava has received little attention compared with cereal crops. We evaluated cassava yield potential and nutrient use efficiency when supplied with nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium at high rates and when supplied with increasing rates of K. On-farm experiments were conducted at six locations in Nigeria across the major cassava growing agro-ecologies of Western Africa (Tropical Rainforest – Cross River, Forest Transition Savanna – Edo, and Guinea Savanna – Benue) during two seasons (2016–2017 and 2017–2018). Nitrogen, P and K fertilizers were applied at various rates, including treatments with and without added secondary and micronutrients. Storage root dry matter (DM) yields ranged between 11 and 35 t DM ha−1. The largest yields were obtained with a mean agronomic efficiency of 60, 162 and 51 kg DM of storage roots per kg of N, P and K applied, with average uptakes of 364, 44 and 242 kg N, P and K ha−1 respectively. Storage root yield responses to applied N, P and K fertilizers (2–18, 3–16 and 3–22 t DM ha−1, respectively) varied across the locations, reflecting variability in potential yields and applied NPK ratios. Addition of a mixture of secondary and micronutrients did not affect cassava yields. We found that the caloric energy yield of cassava per kg of N applied is 2.7 times larger than the value reported for maize. Increasing the supply of K gave a high agronomic efficiency of N even when supplied at high rates, supporting the theory of “increasing returns to scale” of De Wit. We conclude that cassava has a major role in future food security of sub-Saharan Africa, with potentially larger DM yields, a better recovery of applied nutrients and larger energy yield per kg of applied N fertilizer when compared with grains. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - When properly calibrated and evaluated, dynamic crop simulation models can provide insights into the different components of genotype by environment interactions (GEIs). Modelled outputs could be used to complement data from multi-environment trials. Field experiments were conducted in the rainy and dry seasons of 2015 and 2016 across four locations in maize growing regions of Northern Nigeria using 16 maize varieties planted under near-optimal conditions of moisture and soil nitrogen. The CERES-Maize model was calibrated using data from three locations and two seasons (rainy and dry) and evaluated using data from one location and two seasons all in 2015. Observed data from the four locations and two seasons in 2016 was used to create eight different environments. Two profile pits were dug in each location and were used separately in the simulations for each environment to provide replicated data for stability analysis in a combined ANOVA. The effects of the environment, genotype and GEI were highly significant (p = 0.001) for both observed and simulated grain yields. The environment explained 67 % and 64 % of the variations in observed and simulated grain yields respectively. The variance component of GEI (13 % for observed and 15 % for simulated) were lower but still considerable when compared to that of genotypes (19 % for observed and 21 % for simulated). From the stability analysis of the observed and simulated grain yields using six different stability models, three models (ASV, Ecovalence, and Sigma) ranked Ife Hybrid as the most stable variety. The slope of the regression (bi) model ranked Sammaz 11 as the most stable variety, while the Shukla model ranked Sammaz 28 as the most stable variety. Long-term seasonal analysis with the CERES-Maize model revealed that early and intermediate maturing varieties produce high yields in both wet and dry savannas, early and extra-early varieties produce high yields only in the dry savannas, while late maturing varieties produce high yields only in the wet savannas. When properly calibrated and evaluated, the CERES-Maize model can be used to generate data for GEI and stability studies of maize genotype in the absence of observed field data. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Nitrogen (N) fertilizer represents a significant cost for the grower and may also have environmental impacts through nitrate leaching and N2O (a greenhouse gas) emissions associated with denitrification. The objectives of this study were to quantify the genetic variability in N partitioning and N remobilization in Indian spring wheat cultivars and identify traits for improved grain yield and grain protein content for application in breeding N-efficient cultivars. Twenty-eight bread wheat cultivars and two durum wheat cultivars were tested in field experiments in two years in Maharashtra, India. Growth analysis was conducted at anthesis and harvest to assess above-ground dry matter (DM) and dry matter and N partitioning. Flag-leaf photosynthesis rate (Amax), flag-leaf senescence rate and canopy normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were also assessed. Significant N × genotype level interaction was observed for grain yield and N-use efficiency. There was a positive linear association between post-anthesis flag-leaf Amax and grain yield amongst the 30 genotypes under high N (HN) conditions. Flag-leaf Amax was positively associated with N uptake at anthesis (AGNA). Under both HN and low N (LN) conditions, higher N uptake at anthesis was associated with delayed onset of flag-leaf senescence and higher grain yield. Under N limitation, there was a genetic negative correlation between grain yield and grain protein concentration. Deviation from this negative relationship (grain protein deviation or GPD) was related to genotypic differences in post-anthesis N uptake. It is concluded that N uptake at anthesis was an important determinant of flag-leaf photosynthesis rate and grain yield under high N conditions; while post-anthesis N uptake was an important determinant of GPD of wheat grown under low to moderate N conditions in India. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Conventionally managed rice-wheat systems of the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains (E-IGP) that rely on soil puddling for rice and intensive tillage for wheat are low-yielding and resource-inefficient, leading to low profitability. While a host of alternative tillage and crop establishment (TCE) methods have been advocated as solutions for sustainably enhancing productivity and profitability, few systematic comparisons of these methods are reported. To address this gap, a three-year field study was conducted in Bihar, India with the goal of identifying TCE methods for rice-wheat systems that are high yielding, less resource-intensive, and more profitable. The following systems were evaluated: 1) puddled transplanted rice (PTR) followed by (fb) conventional tillage wheat (CTW) or zero-tillage wheat (ZTW); 2) machine transplanted rice in non-puddled soil (MTR) fb ZTW; 3) the system of rice intensification (SRI) fb system of wheat intensification (SWI); and 4) dry-seeded rice (DSR) fb ZTW. Rice cultivar duration (short versus medium-duration) was incorporated as a subplot treatment in all systems. Rice yields were similar with all methods, except DSR yield was 11 % lower and MTR yield was 7% higher than PTR in the third year. Cost of production was US$ 149 and 77 ha−1 lower in DSR and MTR, respectively, and US$ 84 ha-1 higher in SRI than PTR. The gross margin and benefit-cost (B:C) ratio was highest in MTR followed by DSR and lowest in SRI. In wheat, ZT resulted in a higher yield than CTW, especially when ZTW was cultivated after non-puddled rice (e.g., DSR or MTR). ZTW reduced production costs by US$ 69 ha-1, whereas SWI increased it by US$ 139 ha-1 relative to CTW. The higher yield and lower cost of production resulted in a higher gross margin (US$ 82−355 ha−1 and US$ 129−409 ha−1 higher than CTW and SWI, respectively) and a higher B:C ratio in ZTW treatments than CTW and SWI. At the system level, MTR or DSR followed by ZTW had both superior crop yields and consistently higher gross margins (US $133 to 382 ha-1) than other practices. On the other hand, the SRI fb SWI system had no yield advantage and poorer economic performance than conventional practices. In all systems, the inclusion of a medium-duration rice hybrid resulted in higher rice and system yields. These results suggest that significant gains in profitability are possible with emerging TCE practices in rice-wheat systems, but alternatives such as the SRI and SWI will likely erode farmer incomes. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Grain yield progress over 50 years of spring wheat breeding at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) was determined in field trials conducted during five crop seasons (2013–2017) at Norman E. Borlaug research station near Ciudad Obregon, Mexico. The trials included 30 varieties (24 bread wheat and 6 durum wheat) released between 1965–2014 and were sown under managed optimum, drought, and heat stress conditions. The optimum irrigated environment had 3 management systems, flat sowing with weekly drip irrigation (FDI), bed sowing with flood irrigation (BFI), and flat sowing with flood irrigation (FFI). The drought environment had 2 management systems, flat sowing with reduced irrigation (FRI) and flat sowing under severe drought stress (FSD). The heat stress environment was sown in beds (HFI) three months later than the normally sown irrigated and drought environments. The rate of grain yield progress was estimated relative to Sonalika released in 1965 and Mexicali C75 released in 1975 for bread and durum wheat, respectively. Grain yield progress per year for bread wheat was, 31.2 kg ha−1, 35.3 kg ha−1, and 24.7 kg ha−1 in irrigated environments FDI, BFI, and FFI, respectively. In the stress environments, bread wheat grain yield progress was estimated as 25.6 kg ha−1, 17.7 kg ha−1, and 18.1 kg ha−1 per year in FRI, FSD, and HFI, respectively. For durum wheat, the grain yield progress was estimated as 29.6 kg ha−1, 48.1 kg ha−1, 18.8 kg ha−1, and 29.8 kg ha−1, per year in FDI, BFI, FFI, and HFI, respectively. Trait linkage graph analysis using LASSO regularized graphical model estimated that biomass, harvest index, and grains per meter square (GNM) were linked to grain yield progress in all environments. Thousand kernel weight was associated with grain yield progress under optimum and heat stress conditions, whereas grain weight per tiller (GWT) associated with progress under drought. Results also show that the highest yielding varieties in each environment however, had different trait attributes, with some varieties having higher GNM and tillers per meter square compensating for low GWT, while others had high GWT to compensate for reduced GNM. In conclusion, CIMMYT's wheat breeding program has continued to show progress in grain yield in different environments/management systems, and while certain traits have consistently improved over the years, the varieties developed have employed different trait strategies to achieve final grain yield. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The effects of climate change together with the projected future demand represents a huge challenge for wheat production systems worldwide. Wheat breeding can contribute to global food security through the creation of genotypes exhibiting stress tolerance and higher yield potential. The objectives of our study were to (i) estimate the annual grain yield (GY) genetic gain of High Rainfall Wheat Yield Trials (HRWYT) grown from 2007 (15th HRWYT) to 2016 (24th HRWYT) across international environments, and (ii) determine the changes in physiological traits associated with GY genetic improvement. The GY genetic gains were estimated as genetic progress per se (GYP) and in terms of local checks (GYLC). In total, 239 international locations were classified into two groups: high- and low-rainfall environments based on climate variables and trial management practices. In the high-rainfall environment, the annual genetic gains for GYP and GYLC were 3.8 and 1.17 % (160 and 65.1 kg ha−1 yr−1), respectively. In the low-rainfall environment, the genetic gains were 0.93 and 0.73 % (40 and 33.1 kg ha−1 yr−1), for GYP and GYLC respectively. The GY of the lines included in each nursery showed a significant phenotypic correlation between high- and low-rainfall environments in all the examined years and several of the five best performing lines were common in both environments. The GY progress was mainly associated with increased grain weight (R2 = 0.35 p &lt; 0.001), days to maturity (R2 = 0.20, p &lt; 0.001) and grain filling period (R2 = 0.06, p &lt; 0.05). These results indicate continuous GY genetic progress and yield stability in the HRWYT germplasm developed and distributed by CIMMYT. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Wheat is the most commonly grown cereal crop in Europe and in major parts of Europe the most yield limiting disease is Septoria tritici blotch (STB) caused by Zymoseptoria tritici. Currently, the control of the disease depends on cultivar resistance and substantial input of fungicides. The impact of using mixtures of elite cultivars as an alternative was investigated through a meta-analysis based on trial data from the Danish national cultivar testing. The cultivar testing includes a four-way cultivar mixture every year and in these trials STB severity and yield have been monitored at multiple locations between 1995 and 2017. Results from 19 years of cultivar testing trials provided a data set for 406 trials from which the effect of mixtures was evaluated. The meta-analysis revealed that cultivar mixtures reduced STB severity with 10.6% and increased yields with 1.4% across all trials. The effects were greatest in untreated trials where STB severity was reduced with 17% and yields increased with 2.4%. The mixtures did not only perform better than the average of their component cultivars grown as pure stand, they also performed better than the average of the four most grown cultivars in a given year. No relationship was found between disease pressure or location and the performance of the mixtures. The mixtures included in the cultivar testing were not designed to control STB and the results are therefore perceived as a baseline to the attainable disease control from mixtures. The use of cultivar mixtures is relevant for low input farming systems, but can also contribute to disease control in intensive farming systems. Cultivar mixtures have the potential to minimise dependency on fungicides as an important element in integrated pest management. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cover crops are often recommended as a valuable practice to develop more sustainable cropping systems but, despite many benefits, their adoption in practice is still limited mainly because the effects on productivity and economic return are variable. Furthermore, it is still unclear under which combinations with other management practices (e.g. tillage, fertilization, weed control) cover crops can provide the highest paybacks. Here we tested whether cover crops are a suitable management tool to reduce fertilizer input, tillage intensity and herbicide use in Swiss arable cropping systems. We compared the effects of four different cover crop treatments (fallow, radish, subterranean clover and hairy vetch) on maize at two fertilization levels combined with three levels of tillage intensity. To unravel the effects of cover crops on maize growth, we assessed vegetation dynamics using the Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) from aerial spectral imagery. Cover crops on average increased yields by 12 % (+7 % to +20 %) and cover crop effects depended on tillage intensity, fertilization level and cover crop treatment for most of the assessed maize parameters. Best results were obtained with hairy vetch, which increased maize N uptake by 79 kg ha−1 on average. As a consequence, at least combinations of two of the three targeted inputs (tillage, fertilization and herbicides) could be successfully reduced, e.g. tillage and fertilization under no tillage or tillage and herbicides under reduced tillage. Even under intensive tillage, both legume cover crops allowed a reduction of fertilization without compromising yield. Spectral imagery analysis showed that legume cover crops compensated for delayed N availability in reduced and no tillage systems and cover crops contributed to enhanced N uptake and crop growth later in the season. We provide evidence that cover crop based cropping systems can be used to reduce synthetic inputs and tillage without compromising yield, thus presenting an example of ecological engineering. We highlight the importance of considering the whole set of management practices when adopting cover cropping in order to maintain or increase productivity with reduced anthropogenic inputs under conventional cropping. © 2020

AB  - The combination of zero tillage (ZT) and crop residue retention can substantially improve soil structure and reduce the risk of erosion. Growing conditions for crops are substantially altered in such systems and the question whether specific varieties adapted to ZT conditions need to be developed is not answered. Most published research assessed Genotype by Tillage interactions, which are rarely significant, using genotypes generally developed under CT conditions. CIMMYT's durum wheat breeding program went beyond this approach and performed parallel early generation selection within 16 crosses both in conventional tilled (CT) and ZT soils with the aim of comparing the effect of selection environment (either CT or ZT) on the performance of selected progenies. From 16 initial crosses, 234 lines were selected under CT and 250 under ZT. All 484 lines were subsequently tested for yield and growth traits during three seasons near Ciudad Obregon, Sonora, Mexico in three different testing environments. Those included ZT and CT with full irrigation and CT with reduced irrigation. Early vegetative growth was slightly improved with selection under ZT in all testing environments. Grain yield was highest in ZT testing environment, with a very small average difference in 2013 (0.11 t ha-1) and larger differences in 2014 (0.65 t ha-1) and 2015 (0.42 t ha-1). The differences between selection streams observed for yield were marginal and in most cases not significant. We conclude that, within the germplasm pool handled in CIMMYT's durum wheat breeding program, selection can be conducted under either tillage conditions without affecting negatively the performance of resulting progenies. The neutrality of selection under ZT in relation to performance of progenies is a likely hypothesis that should be tested in other ZT conditions and germplasm pool combinations. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Strip intercropping increases land use efficiency but the effect on water use efficiency is less well-known. Here we develop a modelling method to simulate the growth of an intercrop taking into account the acquisition of light and water by the component species in order to calculate the efficacy of light and water acquisition in an intercropping system as compared to sole crops. The model is parameterized, calibrated and validated using data on wheat-maize intercropping in Gansu province, Northwest China. Observed above-ground biomass was 1630 g m−2 for sole wheat and 1334 g m−2 for intercropped wheat while it was 3023 g m−2 for sole maize and 2259 g m−2 for intercropped maize. The average water use was 405 mm in sole wheat, 595 mm in sole maize and 711 mm in wheat-maize intercropping. Based on observed yields, the land equivalent ratio (LER) was 1.59 and the water equivalent ratio (WER) was 1.14, where LER and WER express the relative amounts of land and water needed to achieve the yields obtained in a unit area of intercrop using sole crops. These results indicate that relay strip intercropping of wheat and maize achieves an increase of land use efficiency of 59% and of water use efficiency of 14%. Overall the intercrop model gave satisfactory predictions, with coefficients of efficiency (CE) in validation of 0.86–0.97, 0.90–0.95, 0.85–0.91 and 0.98 for biomass of sole wheat, sole maize, intercropped wheat, and intercropped maize, respectively. Overall CE of water use was 0.95. Simulated LER and WER were similar to observed LER and WER. The results show that intercropping could be used to obtain more yield on less land with less water. Policies that limit water use per unit land and prohibit the use of intercropping on the basis of its high water use per unit area may therefore be counter-productive. The model for intercrop growth and development under water limitation may be used for exploring production possibilities under land and water constraints. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating fungal disease of wheat worldwide causing yield losses and grain contamination with mycotoxins that jeopardise food and feed safety. Field experiments using mulch layers or botanicals were conducted in two consecutive years to investigate prevention measures with the potential to suppress FHB and reduce mycotoxins in wheat. We simulated a system with high disease pressure, i.e. maize-wheat rotation under no-tillage, by applying maize residues artificially inoculated with Fusarium graminearum in field plots after wheat sowing. For mulch layers, a novel cut-and-carry biofumigation approach was employed. Cover crops grown in separate fields were harvested in autumn, chopped and applied directly onto the inoculated maize residues after wheat sowing. Mulch layers of white mustard (Sinapis alba), Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) or berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum) were applied. Botanicals included aqueous extracts of white mustard seed flours or milled Chinese galls and were applied to inoculated maize residues after wheat sowing in autumn or at wheat tillering in spring. Mulch layers of white mustard, Indian mustard or clover consistently suppressed Fusarium infection in both years and decreased mycotoxin contents in wheat grain, i.e. deoxynivalenol by up to 50 %, 58 % and 56 %, and zearalenone by up to 76 %, 71 % and 87 %, respectively. Botanicals were more effective in the second year, when the disease pressure was higher, reducing deoxynivalenol and zearalenone contents in grain by 22%–42% and 60%–78%, respectively. However, there were no clear differences between autumn and spring applications of botanicals on disease pressure and mycotoxin contamination. Mulch layer treatments improved grain yield up to 15 % compared with the positive control, while the botanicals had a minor impact on crop yield. Within the context of sustainable crop protection, cereal growers could benefit from the recommended prevention strategies by decreasing the risk of mycotoxin contamination in harvest products and thus improving grain yield and quality. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Intercropping exploits species complementarities to achieve sustainable intensification by increasing crop outputs per unit land with reduced anthropogenic inputs. Cereal/legume intercropping is a classical case. We carried out a global meta-analysis to assess land and fertilizer N use efficiency in intercropping of maize and soybean as compared to sole crops, based on 47 studies reported in English and 43 studies reported in Chinese. The data were extracted and analyzed with mixed effects models to assess land equivalent ratio (LER) of intercropping and factors affecting LER. The worldwide average LER of maize/soybean intercropping was 1.32 ± 0.02, indicating a substantial land sparing potential of intercropping over sole crops. This advantage increased as the temporal niche differentiation between the two species was increased by sowing or harvesting one crop earlier than the other as in relay intercropping, i.e. with only partial overlap of the growing periods of the two species The mean fertilizer N equivalent ratio (FNER) was 1.44 ± 0.03, indicating that intercrops received substantially less fertilizer N than sole crops for the same product output. These fertilizer savings are mainly due to the high relative maize yield and the lower N input in the intercrop compared to the input in sole maize. This meta-analysis thus shows that exploiting species complementarities by intercropping maize and soybean enables major increases in land productivity with less fertilizer N use. Both LER and FNER increased as the difference in growth duration increased for maize and soybean, but were not affected by fertilizer N rate. LER increased when soil organic matter increased but FNER did not change with soil organic matter. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A wheat association mapping population consisting of 287 diverse spring wheat lines were evaluated for three years in one location (Varanasi) and out of these for one year across three locations (Karnal, Dharwad and Varanasi) in India. Straw fodder quality traits analyzed were nitrogen (N) content, neutral (NDF) and acid (ADF) detergent fiber, acid detergent lignin (ADL), ash (ASH), in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) and metabolizable energy (ME) content. Grain yield (GY) and straw yield (SY) were also recorded. Highly significant (P < 0.0001) differences among lines were observed for all traits except for ADF and ADL in the three years trials conducted at Varanasi. However, year and location had strong (P < 0.0001) effects on all traits. Compared to line-dependent variations in GY and SY variation in straw fodder quality traits were small. Proportionally greatest variations between lines were observed for straw N where lowest and highest N varied by about 30%. Difference for NDF and ADF between lines were at most 4% units and below 3% units for IVOMD. Grain yield and straw yield were positively correlated (P < 0.0001) with GY accounting for 26% of the variation in SY. Straw N, IVOMD and ME were weakly but significantly (P < 0.05) negatively associated with GY and SY. Straw NDF and ADF were significantly (P < 0.05) positively correlated with GY but the association was again weak. Straw NDF, ADF and ADL were also weakly but significantly positively correlated with SY. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were applied to detect significant marker- straw fodder quality trait associations. Five genomic regions contributed for six traits (ADF, ADL, ASH, IVOMD, ME and NDF). ADF and ADL mapped in the common QTL region on chromosome 2B. Similarly, for the IVOMD and ME QTLs on chromosome 5B were associated with SNP marker, wsnp_Ku_c35090_44349517. While some associations were detected for ADF, ALD, ASH, IVOMD, ME and NDF on chromosomes 1A, 2B, 3A, 5A and 5B, the phenotypic variation explained was low to medium by individual QTL. A likely contributing factor was the comparatively small difference in straw fodder quality traits among the lines. It is interesting to note that line dependent variations in GY and SY were about two-fold. In other words, strong genotypic variations of GY and SY do exist. The lack of any similar variations in straw fodder quality traits is intriguing and requires further research. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - The impact of management practices on crop productivity has often been assessed. However, crop response to specific practices may vary as a function of soil type and other associated management practices. The objective of this study was to determine how interactions between tillage, fertilizer source, crop residue management, and pedoclimatic factors affected yield and N use efficiency (NUE) in a corn (Zea mays) - soybean (Glycine max) - spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) rotation in two contrasting soil types. A factorial experiment was conducted from 2009 to 2017, comparing moldboard plow [MB] vs minimum tillage [MT], five fertilizer sources (mineral control without nitrogen [PK], complete mineral fertilizer [NPK], liquid swine manure [LSM], liquid dairy manure [LDM] and solid poultry manure [SPM]), and two crop residue managements (retained [RR] vs harvested [RH]) on a silty clay and a sandy loam. In the silty clay, a positive effect of MT developed over time for all crop species, whereas MT had little effect on wheat yield, generally decreased corn yield and increased soybean yield in the sandy loam. When wheat residues were returned to the soil, corn grain yield in the next year was (i) decreased when combined with MT in both soils and (ii) when combined with liquid manures in the silty clay. In soybean, a positive residual effect of manures was observed under MT in the sandy loam only. For all crop species, yields were more responsive to fertilizer treatments in the sandy loam than in the silty clay, and manures generally performed better with wheat than with corn. Among the manures, LSM was the best fertilizer source. A regression tree indicated that corn grain yield was mainly driven by nitrogen supply (higher yield with &gt; 110 kg available N ha−1) but that a lower response to N is expected in years with drier and colder conditions in July-August. Our results demonstrated that interactions among management practices is determinant for crop productivity, and that yield responses are modulated by crop species, soil type and sometimes, yearly weather conditions. © 2019

AB  - Quantitative differences in tuber bulking of 100 genotypes in a segregating F1 population, their parents (SH, RH) and five contrasting cultivars of potato (Solanum tuberosum) grown in six environments were analysed using a piece-wise expolinear function. Tuber bulking was characterised by three parameters: cm, ED and wmax, where cm and ED were growth rate and effective duration, respectively, of the linear phase of tuber bulking, and wmax was the final tuber dry weight at the end of the linear phase (tE). We also analysed radiation (RUET) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUET), and their relationships with the model parameters. Values of cm and RUET were highest for early-maturing genotypes. Late-maturing genotypes had largest ED and NUET. As a result, wmax was higher in late genotypes than in early genotypes. Most traits exhibited high heritability and high genetic correlations with wmax. Path analysis showed that RUET, cm and a previously quantified parameter for total canopy cover Asum, had a major influence on wmax. Sixteen QTLs were detected for all traits explaining the phenotypic variance by up to 66%. One particular QTL on paternal linkage group V was detected for all traits with a major additive effect and maximum total phenotypic variance. Additional QTLs mostly associated with RH (cm, tE and ED) or both SH-RH linkage groups (NUET, wmax). Our study demonstrates that there are opportunities for improving tuber dry matter yield by selecting an optimal combination of important physiological traits. © 2019

AB  - There has been recently a renewed interest for variety mixtures due to their potential capacity to stabilize production through buffering abiotic and biotic stresses. Part of this results from complementarity and/or compensation between varieties which can be assessed under mixed stands only. Mixing ability of varieties can be partitioned into General and Specific Mixing Abilities (GMA and SMA) that have been estimated so far through the evaluation of binary mixtures in complete diallel designs. However, the number of mixtures increases exponentially with the number of studied varieties, and the only feasible devices are incomplete designs. Despite the long history of statistical analysis of variety mixtures, such incomplete design analysis has rarely been addressed so far. To fill the gap, we proposed a generalized statistical framework to assess mixing abilities based on mixed models and BLUP method, with an original modeling of plant-plant interactions. The approach has been applied to a panel of 25 winter wheat genotypes observed in two contrasted experimental designs: (i) an incomplete diallel of 75 binary mixtures, and (ii) a trial including higher order mixtures (four and eight components). The use of mixing ability models improved prediction accuracy (of modeled values for observed traits) in comparison to predictions from the mean of the pure stand components, especially in the first experiment. Genetic variability was detected for the GMA of yield and its components, whereas variability for SMA was lower. GMA predictions based on the diallel trial were highly correlated with the GMA of the second trial providing accurate inter-trial predictions. A new model has been proposed to jointly account for inter and intra-genotypic interactions for specific mixing ability, thus contributing to a better understanding of mixture functioning. This framework constitutes a step forward to the screening for mixing ability, and could be further integrated into breeding programs for the development of intra- or inter-specific crop mixtures. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Establishing balanced nutrient requirements for maize (Zea mays L.) in the Northern Nigerian Savanna is paramount to develop site-specific fertilizer recommendations to increase maize yield, profits of farmers and avoid negative environmental impacts of fertilizer use. The model QUEFTS (QUantitative Evaluation of Fertility of Tropical Soils) was used to estimate balanced nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) requirements for maize production in the Northern Nigerian Savanna. Data from on-farm nutrient omission trials conducted in 2015 and 2016 rainy seasons in two agro-ecological zones in the Northern Nigerian Savanna (i.e. Northern Guinea Savanna “NGS” and Sudan Savanna “SS”) were used to parameterize and validate the QUEFTS model. The relations between indigenous soil N, P, and K supply and soil properties were not well described with the QUEFTS default equations and consequently new and better fitting equations were derived. The parameters of maximum accumulation (a) and dilution (d) in kg grain per kg nutrient for the QUEFTS model obtained were respectively 35 and 79 for N, 200 and 527 for P and 25 and 117 for K in the NGS zone; 32 and 79 for N, 164 and 528 for P and 24 and 136 for K in the SS zone; and 35 and 79 for N, 199 and 528 for P and 24 and 124 for K when the data of the two zones were combined. There was a close agreement between observed and parameterized QUEFTS predicted yields in each of the agro-ecological zone (R2 = 0.69 for the NGS and 0.75 for the SS). Although with a slight reduction in the prediction power, a good fit between the observed and model predicted grain yield was also detected when the data for the two agro-ecological zones were combined (R2 = 0.67). Therefore, across the two agro-ecological zones, the model predicted a linear relationship between grain yield and above-ground nutrient uptake until yield reached about 50 to 60% of the yield potential. When the yield target reached 60% of the potential yield (i.e. 6.0 t ha−1), the model showed above-ground balanced nutrient uptake of 20.7, 3.4 and 27.1 kg N, P, and K, respectively, per one tonne of maize grain. These results suggest an average NPK ratio in the plant dry matter of about 6.1:1:7.9. We concluded that the QUEFTS model can be widely used for balanced nutrient requirement estimations and development of site-specific fertilizer recommendations for maize intensification in the Northern Nigerian Savanna. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Water and temperature stress during critical periods of grain yield formation are distinctive of wheat crops in Mediterranean environments. However, nitrogen (N) availability may also constrain grain yields in these environments. Benchmarks of yield response to N uptake in Mediterranean conditions are lacking, and extrapolation from non-Mediterranean environments is not warranted. We hypothesised that under Mediterranean environments (1) maximum N uptake would be lower, thus the range of N uptake would be narrower, and (2) N utilisation efficiency (NUtE, yield per unit N uptake) would be reduced along the whole range of N uptake than under non-Mediterranean conditions. To test these hypotheses, we compiled published data of yield and N uptake from Mediterranean (n = 340) and non-Mediterranean environments (n = 563) of Europe. Wheat in Mediterranean environments had lower average grain yield (4.1 vs 7.1 Mg ha−1), lower average N uptake (131 vs 166 kg N ha−1), lower average NUtE (33 vs 47 kg grain kg N−1), and higher average grain N concentration (2.4 vs 1.8%) than crops in non-Mediterranean environments. Boundary functions relating yield and nitrogen uptake captured the lower yield of wheat along the whole range of N uptake as hypothesised; these functions could be used for benchmarking wheat crops in Mediterranean regions of Europe, and possibly other Mediterranean environments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Farmers in low-elevation coastal zones in South Asia face numerous food security and environmental sustainability challenges. This study evaluated the effects of nitrogen (N) rate and source on the agronomic, economic, and environmental performance of transplanted and rainfed ‘aman’ (monsoon-season) rice in Bangladesh's non-saline coastal areas. Fifty-one farmers participated in trials distributed across two landscape positions described as ‘highlands’ (on which field water inundation depth typically remains &lt;30 cm) and ‘medium-highlands’ (inundation depths 30–90 cm) planted singly with varieties appropriate to each position (BRRI dhan 39 for highlands and the traditional variety Bhushiara for lowlands). Researcher designed but farmer-managed dispersed plots were located across three district sub-units (Barisal Sadar, Hizla, Mehendigonj) and compared N source (broadcast prilled urea or deep-placed urea super granules (USG)) at four N rates. Rice grown on medium-highlands did not respond to increasing N rates beyond 28 kg N ha−1, indicating that little fertilization is required to maintain yields and profitability while limiting environmental externalities. In highland locations, clear trade-offs between agronomic and environmental goals were observed. To increase yields and profits for BRRI dhan 39, 50 or 75 kg N ha−1 was often needed, although these rates were associated with declining energy and increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) efficiencies. Compared to prilled urea, USG had no impact on yield, economic, energy and GHG efficiencies in medium-highland locations. USG conversely led to 4.2–5.8% yield improvements at higher N rates on highlands, while also increasing energy efficiency. Given the observed yield, agronomic and economic benefit of USG, our preliminary results that farmers can consider use of USG at 50 kg N ha−1 to produce yields equivalent to 75 kg N ha−1 of prilled urea in highland landscapes, while also reducing environmental externalities. These results suggest that when assessing sustainable intensification (SI) strategies for rice in South Asia's coastal zones, N requirements should be evaluated within specific production contexts (e.g. cultivar type within landscape position) to identify options for increasing yields without negatively influencing environmental and economic indicators. Similar studies in other parts of coastal South Asia could help policy-makers prioritize investments in agriculture with the aim of improving rice productivity while also considering income generation and environmental outcomes. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - To analyze the effects of tillage (no-tillage, plow tillage), irrigation (rainfed, irrigated), and crop rotation (continuous maize, 4-year crop rotation) and their development, we conducted a field experiment over 9 years under sandy soil conditions in northeastern Germany. The generalized linear model showed that tillage, irrigation and crop rotation jointly explained approximately 35% of the total variance. Irrigation and crop rotation significantly positively influenced maize biomass yield started immediately in the first years in 2008 and 2011 respectively, while tillage started to significantly positively affect yield starting from the fourth year. In general, irrigation had the most relative importance as a management factor compared to the importance of tillage and crop rotation. Crop rotation with legumes increased soil nitrogen and carbon content and led to a higher yield than continuous maize 11.1 dt ha−1 y−1 in average. Furthermore, the significant effect of crop rotation on the yield of the following crop (maize) continued after 2 cycles of a 4-year crop rotation. A significant influence of the 2-way interactions between rotation, tillage and irrigation was only found in extremely dry years. It can be concluded that (i) the negative influence of no-tillage becomes noticeable after 3 years, leading to significantly lower yield compared to plow tillage; (ii) under the sandy soil and dry conditions, irrigation significantly increases yields and is the most important factor compared to tillage and crop rotation; and (iii) crop rotation significantly increases and maintains maize yield under both plowed and irrigated conditions. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Barley is one of the most important cereals worldwide and is a key crop for Scotland's agriculture due to its use in distilleries to produce whisky. Climatic variability, especially significant changes in rainfall patterns are a present challenge for barley production. Thus, the objectives of this study were: i) to evaluate the performance of a crop model to simulate water and N stresses in spring barley in the east of Scotland; ii) to quantify the impacts of rainfall and temperature on barley grain yield and quality; and iii) to understand how grain nitrogen concentration varies in relation to climate variability. Three field experiments were undertaken at the James Hutton Institute near Dundee, UK. The 2018 experiment consisted of two levels of N (0 N and 120 N) and two levels of water (rainfed and irrigated). Data from two experiments were used as additional evaluation. The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT v4.7) model was used to evaluate the crop performance. The evaluation of the crop model using the different years, locations and water by nitrogen stress levels, using the same cultivar (Concerto), showed that the cultivar parameters were well calibrated. There was a weak negative and non-significant (p = 0.14) relationship between air temperature and simulated yield, but a strong (p < 0.05) positive relationship between growing season rainfall and simulated yield. During the spring barley growing season (Apr-Aug), the last two decades were drier than the long-term average, with May (time of expansive growth) having about 25 mm less rainfall than the long-term average. The results of this study highlight how rainfall is more important than the temperature for the production of spring barley in Scotland. Our simulated results showed that the premium grain for distilling is reached 41 out of 45 years investigated in this study. © 2019

AB  - Improving biomass is an important goal for future genetic gains in yield potential in wheat, but it will also be crucial to identify physiological traits to maximize harvest index (HI, proportion of aboveground biomass in grain). Increased grain partitioning will require increased dry-matter (DM) partitioning to the spikes at anthesis as well as enhanced fruiting efficiency (FE, grains per g spike dry matter at anthesis or chaff dry matter at harvest), whilst optimizing the partitioning amongst the non-grain components to maintain post-anthesis photosynthetic capacity and soluble carbohydrate translocation. The objectives of this study were to: i) quantify genetic variation in DM partitioning among plant organs at anthesis (GS65) + 7 days and associations with spike growth and FE and ii) identify optimized partitioning traits associated with enhanced HI and grain yield, in CIMMYT elite spring wheat backgrounds. Two field experiments were conducted in 2011-12 and 2012-13 testing 26 CIMMYT spring wheat cultivars in NW Mexico in irrigated conditions in which DM partitioning was assessed in plant organs at anthesis + 7 days, and within-spike (glume, palea, lemma, rachis and awn) partitioning was assessed at harvest for a subset of 17 cultivars. Grain yield, yield components, HI and FE were assessed at harvest. Our results identified new traits for HI (decreased DM partitioning to stem internodes 2 (top down, peduncle -1) and 3, and decreased rachis DM partitioning and rachis specific weight (rachis DM per rachis unit length) and increased lemma DM partitioning), potentially allowing breeders to maximize the exploitation of enhanced carbon assimilation for grain biomass. Further work will focus on understanding the role of soluble carbohydrate re-translocation in these relationships and establishing high-throughput and cost-effective phenotyping methods for these traits for deployment in breeding. © 2019

AB  - Accurate estimation of nitrogen (N) balance (a measure of potential N losses) in producer fields requires information on grain N concentration (GNC) to estimate grain-N removal, which is rarely measured by producers. The objectives of this study were to (i) examine the degree to which variation in GNC can affect estimation of grain-N removal, (ii) identify major factors influencing GNC, and (iii) develop a predictive model to estimate GNC, analyzing the uncertainty in predicted grain-N removal at field and regional levels. We compiled GNC data from published literature and unpublished databases using explicit criteria to only include experiments that portray the environments and dominant management practices where maize is grown in the US North Central region, which accounts for one-third of global maize production. We assessed GNC variation using regression tree analysis and evaluated the ability of the resulting model to estimate grain-N removal relative to the current approach using a fixed GNC. Across all site-year-treatment cases, GNC averaged 1.15%, ranging from 0.76 to 1.66%. At any given grain yield, GNC varied substantially and resulted in large variation in estimated grain-N removal and N balance. However, compared with GNC, yield differences explained much more variability in grain-N removal. Our regression tree model accounted for 35% of the variation in GNC, and returned physiologically meaningful associations with mean air temperature and water balance in July (i.e., silking) and August (i.e., grain filling), and with N fertilizer rate. The predictive model has a slight advantage over the typical approach based on a fixed GNC for estimating grain-N removal for individual site-years (root mean square error: 17 versus 21 kg N ha−1, respectively). Estimates of grain-N removal with both approaches were more reliable when aggregated at climate-soil domain level relative to estimates for individual site-years. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Further efforts are needed to combat poverty and agricultural productivity problems in the delta region of Bangladesh. Sustainable intensification of crop production through irrigation and production of cash crops such as maize and wheat might be a promising option to increase income and diversify food production. Only limited research has however been conducted on the potential of using surface water from canals as an irrigation source for maize and wheat production in the delta region. To better understand the contribution of shallow groundwater to crop production and number of irrigations needed for maize and wheat in this unique coastal environment, we conducted multi-locational trials on farmers' fields over three rabi seasons. In addition to soil moisture and salinity, we recorded the depth and salinity of the shallow water table throughout these experiments. Maize in particular requires considerable capital investment for seeds, fertilizer, irrigation and labor. Although farmers express wide interest in maize – which can be sold as a profitable cash crop into Bangladesh's expanding poultry feed industry – many of them are reluctant to invest in fertilizer because of the high entry costs. We therefore also investigated the profitability of growing maize under low and high (recommended) fertilizer regimens. Volumetric soil moisture at sowing and during the grain filling phase or at maturity indicated that there is ample supply of water in the profile. Most measurements were above the drained upper limit (DUL). We attributed this to the generally shallow water table depths, which never exceeded 2.75 m at any location, but generally stayed between 1–2 m depth throughout the season. The region's soil texture classes (clay loams, silt loams and silty clay loams) are all conducive for capillary rise of water into the rooting zone. Consequently, irrigation had a significant effect on maize yield in the driest winter only, whereas for wheat, it had no effect. The key for a successful maize and wheat production in the delta region of Bangladesh is to ensure a good crop establishment, which can be achieved with a starter and an additional irrigation at crown root initiation for wheat and at V6-8 for maize. Maize however is not always profitable. Compared to low fertilizer rates, higher rates reduced losses in low yielding site-years and increased profits in high-yielding site years. This indicates that it is advisable for farmers not to reduce fertilizer rates. Low-risk financial credit with rationally structured interest rates that allow farmers to invest in maize could potentially offset these constraints. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Since the early 2000s conservation agriculture (CA)has been promoted in the Lake Alaotra region of Madagascar for a more sustainable and profitable agriculture. There is, however, little known about its performance in low-input rainfed rice-based cropping systems. We conducted a study during two growing seasons (2013/14 and 2014/15)on an experiment that was established in 2009 at the agricultural research station of the National Center for Applied Research and Rural Development (FOFIFA)in the Lake Alaotra region of Madagascar. The experimental setup was a randomized block design with four replications. Two soil/residue management treatments were studied, conventional tillage without residue retention (CT)and no-tillage with residue retention (NT). These two treatments were tested for a 2-year rotation of maize + Dolichos lablab followed by rice (MD//R)and a 3-year rotation of maize + Stylosanthes guianensis, followed by S. guianensis in the second year, and rice in the third year (MS//S//R). During the 2013/14 and 2014/15 seasons, two levels of weed pressure: ‘high’ and ‘low’ were introduced as a split-plot design on the rice plots. The main determining factors of rice yield in the study region were studied: radiation interception, weed infestation, soil moisture and soil mineral nitrogen (N). Our results showed that five to six years of continuous practice of NT with retention of high amounts of crop residues (more than 5 Mg DM ha−1)on the soil surface had a significant (p = 0.02)positive effect on rice yield, irrespective of the level of weed pressure and type of crop rotation. CA systems significantly (p &lt; 0.05)reduced weed density and biomass as compared to CT particularly during the vegetative stage of the rice crop in the two growing seasons, which to a certain extent explained the yield gains under CA. In contrast, treatment effects on soil moisture and mineral N contents were marginal. The positive effects of CA on reduced weed pressure may constitute an important benefit for smallholder farmers, who face labour constraints with hand weeding, and usually cannot afford herbicides for weed control. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rice (Oryza sativa L.)in the tropics is often produced in small landholdings, which can vary in farming practices that influence optimal management of fertilizer. A web-based decision support tool named Rice Crop Manager (RCM)was developed for the Philippines to handle variability in optimal fertilization by calculating field-specific nutrient management. RCM adapted principles developed earlier with site-specific nutrient management (SSNM). We explain the selection and calibration of calculations used by RCM to determine fertilizer N, P, and K requirements for irrigated and rainfed rice. A financial analysis will be reported in other manuscripts evaluating the performance of RCM. A yield-gain approach calculated nutrient rate to achieve a target yield, as a direct function of the estimated yield gain with added nutrient. Yield gains with added N, P, and K were estimated from 282 nutrient omission plot technique (NOPT)trials conducted across the Philippines. Each NOPT trial had a full fertilization plot and nutrient omission plots without added N (0-N), without added P (0-P), and without added K (0-K). Differences in yield between full fertilization and nutrient omission plots provided an estimate of yield gain with added nutrient as a function of a target yield with full fertilization. RCM calculated a unique target yield for each field in each growing season based on field-specific crop management and historical yields, which RCM collected through a pre-season interview of a farmer. RCM calculated fertilizer N rates with a yield-gain approach using mean yield gain estimated for a target yield from countrywide NOPT trials, a target agronomic efficiency of fertilizer N, and a field-specific target yield within the range of 3–9 Mg ha–1. RCM calculated fertilizer K rates with a combined yield-gain + nutrient-balance approach, which considered K inputs from crop residues and irrigation water. We conducted 299 measurements of K in irrigation water across the Philippines to develop a countrywide estimate of K input from irrigation water of 21 kg K ha–1 in the dry season and 8 kg K ha–1 in the wet season. RCM calculated fertilizer P rates using a nutrient-balance approach, which estimated field-specific P inputs from crop residue. It avoided depletion of soil P through use of higher P rates than a yield-gain approach. The algorithms and calibrations for RCM in the Philippines form a basis that can be improved as new information becomes available. The algorithms and procedures for calibration can also be used to develop and enhance nutrient management decision support tools for rice in other countries. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Processing of organic residues may affect plant-availability of phosphorus (P)and thus the potential to recycle the nutrient, i.e., recyclability, but empirical evidence in the field is lacking. In field experiments in clay and silt loam soils with low available P, impact on P recyclability by cattle manure and sewage sludge processing methods (composting, anaerobic digestion, lime-stabilization, acid-oxidizer)and three application rates were assessed. Synthetic nitrogen (N)and potassium (K)fertilizers were supplied in surplus and NPK served as a reference. The differences in plant response were small at relevant application rates and not consistently explained by solubility of fertilizer P. Least P was required in composted manure for the same P uptake in silt loam, and composting was beneficial to plant response in clay as well. Lime-stabilization of sewage sludge had an adverse effect on P uptake in silt loam. Increasing application rates of sewage sludge hardly enhanced but did not lower P uptake or yield even at an excessive rate. Soil water-extractable P in the autumn liable to leaching was increased by NPK only. In clay soil, sewage sludges performed better than manures obviously due to anaerobic conditions caused by high precipitation, but in silt loam the contrary was the case. In conclusion, the availability of P in processed residues is more susceptible to weather and soil variables than in synthetic fertilizer. P fertilization benefits in cereal cropping in current north European conditions appear to be generally small. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - The rainfed USA Midwestern region has deep, fertile soils and leads the USA in soybean [Glycine max, (L.) Merr.] production. Biological nitrogen (N) fixation (BNF) contributes a portion of the soybean N requirement, but variability in BNF is poorly understood and estimates of BNF for this region are rare. We established experiments in Iowa, USA to gain a better understanding of BNF and increase its predictability. We collected in-season BNF measurements accompanied by high temporal resolution soil and plant growth measurements. Across two years, two locations and two planting dates, we found that BNF contributed 23–65% of total aboveground N accumulation in soybean. The BNF rate was maximized at the early seed-filling period and varied from 1 to 3 kg N ha−1day−1. During seed filling period, the rate of BNF was related to crop growth rate (carbon (C) supply) but not to N accumulation by the reproductive organs (N demand). We found that a minimum crop growth rate of 135 kg dry matter ha−1day-1 is required to sustain maximum BNF rates. In contrast to BNF, the soil inorganic N uptake rate was related to seed N demand but not to C supply. Biomass production was the best predictor of total soybean BNF (R2 &gt; 0.83). On average, 0.013 kg N was fixed per kg biomass produced. Across all trials, the N exported via seed was greater than the N imported via BNF, which suggests that Midwest US soybeans may reduce soil organic matter. We concluded that future research efforts should focus on increasing C – rather than N – availability during the seed filling period towards improving both grain yields and environmental sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Dense planting with reducing nitrogen rate (DPRN) is a sustainable strategy to improve rice yield and nitrogen (N) use efficiency. Nevertheless, the feasibility of such strategy under low light stress condition has not been examined in detail. Two field experiments and a micro-plot experiment were conducted to evaluate the performance of DPRN and sparse planting with high N rate (SPHN) under two light conditions (L 0 , natural light intensity and L 1 , 30% of L 0 ) with two contrasting hybrid rice varieties (Yliangyou 1 and Luoyou 9348) in 2014 and 2015. In field experiments, L 1 resulted in sharp decline in grain filling, 1000-grain weight, biomass, harvest index, N uptake, N use efficiency for grain production and partial factor productivity of applied N fertilizer, and consequently 41.2–53.4% grain yield loss for two varieties in comparison with L 0 . Interestingly, 8.6–13.5% higher grain yield, and better performance of yield components and N use efficiency were observed from DPRN than SPHN across two light conditions. In micro-plot experiment, responses of grain dry weight and yield-attributing traits to light intensity and crop managements were similar to those in field experiments. No difference was observed in N uptake from fertilizer, N recovery rate, N retention rate and N loss rate between L 0 and L 1 , while DPRN increased N recovery rate by 14.8% and N retention rate by 35.1%, and consequently decreased N loss rate by 29.4% across two light conditions compared with SPHN. The differences in responses of grain yield and related parameters to low light stress (L 1 ) between the two cultivars were small. These results suggest that DPRN is also feasible to increase grain yield and N use efficiency for hybrid rice varieties grown under two light conditions. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz] is a short-season annual oilseed crop in the Brassicaceae family. Interest in camelina has increased substantially during the past 15 years because the oil is an excellent feedstock for producing low-carbon-emission biofuel and has a unique fatty acid profile as a potential edible oil. Camelina has been promoted as an alternative crop in low-precipitation dryland regions because of its low fertilizer requirement and drought tolerance. An 8-yr field experiment was conducted from 2010 to 2017 at the WSU Dryland Research Station near Lind, WA to compare a 3-yr winter wheat (WW)-spring camelina-summer fallow (SF) rotation with the traditional 2-yr WW-SF rotation. Annual crop-year (Sept. 1-Aug. 31) precipitation ranged from 193 to 375 mm and averaged 281 mm. Camelina seed yield ranged from 339 to 1175 kg/ha and averaged 643 kg/ha. Mean WW yield of 2692 kg/ha in the 3-yr rotation was significantly lower (p = 0.046) compared to 2862 kg/ha in the 2-yr rotation. Soil profile water was significantly lower (p < 0.001) after harvest of camelina compared to after WW harvest in the 2-yr rotation. This soil water reduction was consistently measured throughout the ensuing 13-month fallow cycle. There are no labeled in-crop broadleaf weed herbicides for camelina and populations of Russian thistle (Salsola tragus L.) and tumble mustard (Sisymbrium altissimum L.) were higher in camelina than in WW. This was likely a factor in the deep extraction of soil water in the camelina plots to a depth of 180 cm. Data from this study suggest that, with current cultivars and management practices, camelina is not yet agronomically or economically stable or viable in a 3-yr WW-camelina-SF rotation in the low-precipitation (<300 mm annual) rainfed cropping region of the Inland Pacific Northwest (PNW). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hairy vetch (HV, Vicia villosa Roth) is a winter annual legume cultivated for pasture grazing, in crop rotations with cereal crops under semi-arid conditions. The inclusion of HV increases soil nitrogen, thus contributing to satisfied the nutrient requirements of the successive crops. As a forage crop, HV shows a remarkable capability for natural reseeding. This study aimed to develop and validate a simulation model to evaluate HV self-regeneration capacity considering different HV–winter cereal crop rotation (pasture-crop phase) scenarios. Predicted HV plant density for the evaluated crop sequences matched observed values. HV yield and seed rain were the most important variables affecting seedbank replenishment and self-regeneration capacity. HV monoculture permits successive natural reseeding to reach a basal stand threshold of 30 plants m −2 , required for a productive pasture. In a HV-cereal-HV crop rotation, the HV self-regeneration capacity requires a minimum seed yield of 185 and 240 kg ha −1 at the end of the first season under conventional (CT) and no tillage (NT) systems, respectively. Natural seedbank replenishment would not be enough to establish a productive pasture by self-regeneration after two or more successive years of cereals. From a weed management perspective, HV control should not be a considerable problem as a “volunteer plants” if management practices avoid seed production and seedbank replenishment for at least three consecutive years. These outcomes suggest the potential applicability of the proposed modelling approach within management decision support systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Application of biochar has been shown to increase soil fertility and enable soil carbon sequestration, indicating potential for agricultural and environmental benefits from using locally produced biochar on African smallholder farms. However, previous studies have been rather short-term and little is known about the longer-term effects of biochar application on crop yields. Biochar contains ash, but the potential liming effect and nutrient release from ash may be short-lasting. To investigate long-term effects, we set up a series of field trials replicated at three sites in Kenya in 2006. The trials are still on-going and are possibly the longest biochar trials in sub-Saharan Africa. Here, we report effects on crop yield and soil properties over 10 years after applying biochar, produced mainly from Acacia spp., at a rate of 50 + 50 Mg ha −1 during the first two seasons. Maize (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max) were grown in rotation, with or without inorganic fertiliser, and crop yield was monitored. For comparison of soil properties, additional plots were kept in bare fallow. Biochar addition slightly increased soil porosity, pH, plant-available phosphorus and soil water-holding capacity. Crop yield responded positively to biochar at all sites and yield responses were similar with and without mineral fertiliser, i.e., the effects of biochar and mineral fertiliser were additive. The seasonal yield increase due to biochar application was in average around 1.2 Mg ha −1 for maize and 0.4 Mg for soybean, independently of fertilisation, over seasons and sites. Application of mineral fertiliser to maize increased maize yield by 1.6 Mg ha −1 and the subsequent, unfertilized soybean yield by 0.6 Mg ha −1 , illustrating a carry-over effect. Most importantly, the effect on maize and soybean yield of adding biochar to soil persisted over the whole 10-year period. Analysis of the carbon (C) balance in topsoil indicated that about 40% of biochar C was apparently lost through mineralization, erosion or vertical translocation. Moreover, changes in soil carbon/nitrogen ratios indicated that biochar application increased nitrogen mineralization from native soil organic matter. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentration (e[CO 2 ]) often increases cereal yield, but can also decrease vegetative and grain tissue nitrogen (N) concentration that might affect future food and feed quality. However, data about CO 2 x N interactions on key processes determining grain N yield and concentration, which are remobilization of vegetative N taken up before anthesis (Nrem) and post-anthesis N uptake (Nabs), are scarce. Therefore, a two-year Free Air CO 2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment was conducted with winter wheat grown under two CO 2 (˜393 and 600 ppm) and three N levels (severe deficiency with N nutrition index (NNI) of 0.4, adequate with NNI of 0.8 and excess with NNI of 1.1). e[CO 2 ] did not influence the allometric relation between aboveground N concentration and biomass up to anthesis. At anthesis, e[CO 2 ] increased N acquisition of stem and ear, but not of leaf. Correspondingly, e[CO 2 ] increased Nrem of stem and chaff. Moreover, e[CO 2 ] enhanced the efficiency of Nrem of stem and aboveground plant in the first year, indicating increased N mobilization from vegetative tissue. Nabs tended to be increased by e[CO 2 ], especially in the second year. Finally, e[CO 2 ] increased grain N yield (8 to 12%), N use efficiency (13 to 18%) and N uptake efficiency (10 to 12%). Grain N concentration was slightly decreased by e[CO 2 ] in both years (-1 to -6%), while grain N concentration was considerably larger (9 to 19%) in the second year compared to the first year. There was a strong linear relation between grain N yield and grain number (r 2 = 0.98) that was not influenced by e[CO 2 ], suggesting grain number as important factor determining the grain N yield increase under e[CO 2 ]. Grain N concentration was more strongly affected by e[CO 2 ] than mean N content per grain. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Weeds can harm crop growth and yield by competing for light, water, and nutrients and can produce high global potential yield losses if not controlled. However, the effects of weed diversity have not been fully examined. Here, we have used long-term data (31 years) of a cereal–legume rotation from a locality in central Spain to determine the importance of internal and external (weather and weed diversity) factors on crop yield. We used a novel methodology based on dynamic systems to explore how weed diversity and weather factors interact with crop yields. The dynamic model used here integrated internal and external factors with additive or non-linear variants. We showed that internal processes (self-regulation) are involved in wheat and legume yield temporal fluctuations. The self-regulation of crop production appears to be stronger in cereal (85%) than in legume (45%) systems, and therefore legumes seem to be more sensitive to external variations. The legume crop was not affected by weed diversity but was instead negatively influenced by average temperature for the growing season. In wheat, there was a negative, non-linear response of yield to the interaction between richness and minimum temperature for the growing season. An improved understanding of the influence of weed diversity on crop yield may help to anticipate the effects of climate change and guide management practices to maintain crop productivity under sustainable agriculture. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Grain number (GN) is critical for yield determination, and understanding its physiology may be instrumental to further improving yield. Studying similarities and differences in yield physiology among cereals may highlight physiological traits that might become critical for understanding some constitutive differences between them. Recently it has been proposed that fruiting efficiency (FE, grains set per unit of inflorescence dry weight at anthesis IDWa) would be a relevant trait to further increase GN. In this research we report for the first time a comparison of GN determination due to IDWa and/or FE between five winter cereals crops (wheat, rye, barley, oats and triticale), analysing likely physiological bases for them and possible trade-offs. First, we performed a literature search and found a small number of papers on FE, mostly in wheat with limited data available for barley and triticale and nothing on oats and rye. Then, we conducted four experiments in which treatments consisted of the five small-grained cereal crops; in two of the experiments genotypes were combined with two levels of soil nitrogen availability. In triticale and barley the relationships between GN and either IDWa or FE were not significant implying that in these two cereals the environmental conditions affected in some cases one, while in other cases the other, physiological determinant of grain number. In wheat and rye, however, the relationships were clearer (and more significant) with FE than with SDWa, while for oats it was the other way around. Triticale and wheat showed the lowest FE values, rye exhibited the highest, and barley and oats were intermediate. When compared across cereals, FE was negatively related to the average spike- or panicle-DWa, indicating a trade-off in interspecific determination of GN. No relationship was found between FE and grain set percentage: differences in FE were mainly due to variation in the efficiency of setting fertile florets during pre-flowering inflorescence growth. The results also evidenced that this efficiency for setting fertile florets was related to the proportion of inflorescence resources partitioned to the growth of floret primordia. We observed no trade-off between FE and grain weight within each of the species, but an overall negative relationship when comparing across cereals (the latter likely explaining constitutive differences in grain weight among species). Therefore, it seemed that manipulations of FE within each of the species would not necessarily bring about compensations through reductions in grain weight and that to further increase fruiting efficiency cereal breeders may benefit from identifying prospect parents with an allocation of resources away from structural parts of the spikelets in favour of survival of labile florets. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introgressions of Thinopyrum ponticum 7AgL chromosome segments, spanning 23%, 28% and 40% of the distal end of durum wheat 7AL arm, were previously shown to contain multiple beneficial gene(s)/QTL for yield-related traits, in addition to effective disease resistance (Lr19, Sr25) and quality (Yp) genes. In the present study, durum wheat near isogenic recombinant lines (NIRLs), harbouring each of the three introgressions, were included for the first time in multi-location field trials, to evaluate general and environment-specific effects of the alien chromatin on 26 yield-related traits. Results from nine different trials across contrasting environments of Italy, Morocco and South Australia over four years revealed that the overall impact of 7AgL introgressions into the tetraploid wheat background did not incur, except in one environment, a major yield penalty. The effect of the three 7AgL segments on individual yield-contributing traits resulted in significant increases of biomass m−2 (+9%), spike number m−2 (+13%), grain number m−2 (+11%) and spikelet-1 (+8%), as well as a significant decrease in grain weight (−8%). When the separate NIRLs were analysed, each of the three 7AgL segments were associated with specific yield component variation. The effects of the 40%-long segment proved to be the most stably expressed across environments and involved significant increases of spike and grain number m−2 (13% and 15%, respectively), grain number spike-1 (10%) and spike fertility index (46%), though accompanied by a significant decrease in thousand grain weight (−23%). In spite of this trade-off between grain number and grain weight, their interplay was such that in four trials, including drier environments, a grain yield advantage was observed. This evidence, and comparison with the two other NIRLs, substantiates the hypothesized existence of major gene(s)/QTL for grain number in the most proximal 28–40% 7AgL region, exclusive to the 40%-long 7AgL introgression. The present study represents an important validation of the use of chromosomally engineered genetic stocks for durum wheat improvement, targeting not only disease resistance and quality traits but also relevant yield components. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding the physiological factors which allow or constrain maize (Zea mays L.) recovery from vegetative N stress when N fertilizer is added near flowering is important for N management decisions. To study the capacity of maize to recover from vegetative N stress, we conducted a two-year experiment comparing seven hybrids (released between 1946 and 2015) and five N treatments - a 0 N control (0_0) and four treatments which received a total of 220 kg N ha−1 applied either 100% at V4 (220_0), 100% at R1 (0_220), 75% at V4 and 25% at R1 (165_55), or 25% at V4 and 75% at R1 (55_165). These N treatments created a range of N deficiencies at flowering. There was no indication that yield response to the timing of N application had changed over the past 70 years of hybrid improvement. Compared to 220_0, grain yield was significantly lowered by the delayed application of 0_220 (relative yield of 89%) but not by the split applications of 55_165 or 165_55 (relative yields of 93 and 100%, respectively), although both 0_220 and 55_165 were under N stress at R1, as indicated by the N Nutrition Index. The reasons for the lower grain yield in 0_220, but not 55_165, appeared to be 1) low vegetative-stage N accumulation which could not be compensated for by increased post-silking N uptake, 2) lack of recovery of leaf N status following the R1 N application, and 3) significantly reduced biomass accumulation during the vegetative growth. These findings provide a better understanding of the ability of maize to recover from moderate early-season N stress and will aid agronomists in making management decisions regarding the timing of N fertilizer applications. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Nepal is at a crossroads of diminishing farm-labor and inadequate investment into farming operations that, among other factors, have stagnated domestic wheat yield. Cultural and economic constraints have hindered the widespread adoption of more expensive precision agriculture technologies like zero-till that have the capacity to improve labor and farm input efficiencies. To capture the benefits from added precision of application but with the ability to fit within the current semi-mechanized seed bed preparation and tillage system, we introduced a low-cost, chest mounted seed and fertilizer. We found that simple mechanization caused yield efficiencies to be positive and significant for nitrogen and phosphate. Seed rates using this method were positively associated with seedling density. This led to both yield and profit being more predictable for farmers. Conversely, hand-applied inputs caused a disassociation between inputs and end of season yield and therefore added a large measure of risk to their farming operations. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - A prerequisite for integrated crop model applications is the evaluation at the desired spatial and temporal scale. Here, we analysed the eco-hydrological model SWIM simulating crop yields. Historic simulations for winter wheat and silage maize from 1991 to 2010 were used to examine the model performance at the county level in reproducing the county statistics for crop yields. The focus laid on the replication of mean yield levels and interannual crop yield variability. Simulations of silage maize performed better than simulations of winter wheat with R2-values for interannual yield variability of 0.72 and 0.26 respectively at the national level. In particular, silage maize showed a tendency to perform better in areas of lower soil water availability. The reasons for the clear superiority of silage maize were supposedly the short growing season, the lower susceptibility to pests and diseases and, hence, the direct translation of water stress into yield reductions. This signal was less evident for winter wheat and was additionally superposed of climate induced biotic and abiotic stresses – primarily originating in the cold season - which were not implemented in the model. Overall, the simulation bias seemed to originate rather from unconsidered processes than from uncertainties of input data or in model parameterisation. © 2018

AB  - Applying alternative fertilization practices instead of conventional fertilizers might improve rice yield and nutrient use efficiency in rice cropping systems. However, the results range widely among individual studies, making generalizations difficult. Here, we investigated five alternative fertilization options (slow-release nitrogen fertilizer, SRF; organic fertilizer, OF; straw return, SR; green manure, GM; secondary/micronutrient fertilizer, SMF) and performed a meta-analysis to quantify their effects on rice yield and nitrogen (N) use efficiency across different rice types in China. Yield responses were significantly positive under all alternative fertilization options relative to those obtained with conventional fertilization, and the magnitude of yield increase exhibited the following the order: OF (7.8%) > SRF (7.4%) > GM (6.7%) > SR (5.4%) > SMF (4.6%). Furthermore, the recovery efficiency (REN), agronomic efficiency (AEN), and the partial factor productivity of nitrogen (PFPN) were increased by 6.0–34.8%, 10.2–29.5%, and 4.7–6.9%, respectively under the alternative fertilization options relative to conventional fertilization. The application of SRF and SMF generated higher yield responses in single rice than in other rice types, whereas OF and SR application resulted in better performance in early and middle rice. The rice yield response was maximized when approximately 70% slow-release N was combined with approximately 30% conventional N according to the quadratic relationship between the percentage of slow-release N substituting conventional N and the yield response. It was estimated that the total N rate could be reduced by up to 32% without yield loss with the application of slow-release N fertilizer instead of conventional N fertilizer. When organic N fully or partially substituted inorganic N, yield response declined with increasing substitution level, and the substitution proportion needed to be controlled below 20% to maintain rice yield. The meta-analysis results clearly demonstrate that appropriate alternative fertilization options can increase both rice yield and nitrogen use efficiency, and that conventional chemical fertilizers can be partially replaced with alternative ones without negatively affecting rice productivity. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Nitrogen (N) fertilizer represents a significant cost for the grower and may also have environmental impacts through nitrate leaching and N2O (a greenhouse gas) emissions associated with denitrification. The objectives of this study were to quantify the genetic variability in N-use efficiency (NUE) in Indian spring wheat cultivars and identify traits for improved NUE for application in breeding. Twenty eight bread wheat cultivars and two durum wheat cultivars were tested in field experiments in two years in Maharashtra, India. Detailed growth analysis was conducted at anthesis and harvest including dry matter (DM) and N partitioning. Senescence of the flag leaf was assessed from a visual score every 3–4 days from anthesis to complete flag-leaf senescence and fitted against thermal time to estimate the onset and end of post-anthesis senescence. Grain yield (GY) was reduced under low N (LN) by an average of 1.46 t ha−1 (−28%). Significant N × genotype level interaction was observed for grain yield and NUE. Above-ground N uptake at harvest was reduced from 162 kg N ha−1 under high N (HN) to 85 kg N ha−1 under low N (LN) conditions, while N-utilization efficiency (grain DM yield per unit crop N uptake at harvest; NUtE) increased from 32.7 to 44.6 kg DM kg−1 N. Genetic variation in GY under LN related mainly to variation in N uptake at harvest rather than NUtE; and the N × genotype effect for GY was mainly explained by the interaction for N uptake at harvest. Averaging across years, the linear regression of onset of flag-leaf senescence on GY amongst cultivars was significant under both HN (R2 0.16. p &lt; 0.05) and LN (R2 0.21, p &lt; 0.05) conditions. Onset of flag-leaf senescence was positively associated with N uptake at anthesis under HN (R2 0.34, p &lt; 0.001) and LN (R2 0.22, p &lt; 0.01) conditions. Flag-leaf senescence timing was not associated with post-anthesis N uptake. It is concluded that increased N accumulation at anthesis was correlated with flag-leaf senescence timing and that N accumulation at anthesis is an important trait for enhancing grain yield and NUE of wheat grown under low to moderate N supply in India. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Senescence is a key physiological process that can regulate crop grain yield. Patterns of leaf senescence and its association with grain yield for a short maturity maize hybrid were investigated in a factorial combination of two tillage treatments (conventional and no-till), three amounts of stubble (0, 3 and 5 t ha−1) and three N rates (0, 80 and 120 kg N ha−1) over three seasons in 2015 long rains, 2015/2016 short rains and 2016 long rains. Leaf senescence from flowering to harvest was assessed at (a) the whole-plant scale by the visual scoring of dry leaves and (b) the canopy-layer scale by measuring leaf greenness with a SPAD 502 chlorophyll meter. A bilinear model was used to quantify the patterns of senescence at the whole-plant scale. A logistic function was fitted to estimate the traits of senescence at three canopy layers (top, mid, bottom), including minimum and maximum SPAD, onset of senescence (EC90), time to loss of 50% maximum SPAD (EC50) and the rate of senescence in each layer. Nitrogen rate effect on patterns and traits of senescence were large and its interactions with stubble were more frequent than interactions between other treatments. Tillage and stubble amount had marginal effects. EC50 was delayed in the unfertilized controls compared with fertilized crops and was negatively correlated with grain yield. Rate of senescence was faster in fertilised crops compared with unfertilized controls at both whole-plant and canopy-layer scales. Grain yield, grain number and nitrogen remobilization efficiency were associated with faster rates of senescence in the top and mid leaves but with slower rates of senescence in the bottom layer leaves. We advance a sink-driven leaf senescence ideotype for high yield and efficient use of nitrogen for short maturity maize. © 2018

AB  - Food security is one of the most important challenges facing human kind. A very promising approach to solve the problem is closing the yield gap, i.e. the difference between farmer's and potential yield. A ‘complete yield gap assessment method’ must provide information regarding potential yield, actual yield and yield gap, the causes of the gap and their importance. The objective of this study was to indicate how boundary line analysis (BLA) could be applied to such an assessment. BLA was only applied to crop management practices/inputs, e.g. sowing date and rate and fertilizer applications. The data were gathered from about 700 wheat farms in Golestan province, one of the major wheat producing regions in Iran, during two growing seasons of 2013–2014 and 2014–2015. Wheat production in Golestan province can be divided into three production situations according to agro- and geo-climatology criteria: these are ‘irrigated or high-rainfall’, ‘high-yield rainfed’, and ‘low-yield rainfed’. Boundary lines were fitted to the edge of the data cloud of crop yield versus management variables using data from each of the three wheat production situations in the province. Actual farmers’ yields were 3900 kg ha–1 for irrigated, 4000 kg ha–1 for high-yield rainfed and 2000 kg ha–1 for low-yield-rainfed situations; BLA indicated that potential yields (the highest yields obtained by farmers in the sample) were 6900, 5800 and 3900 kg ha−1 for each situation, respectively. The corresponding yield gaps were high at 42%, 31% and 50%. Using BLA it was possible to determine the optimal sowing date, seeding rate, frequency and amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied, amount of nitrogen top-dressing, amount of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers and irrigation frequency. The percentage of farmers who cultivated outside of the optimal levels was also identified and was used to determine the importance of each management factor in yield gap. It was concluded that BLA as applied in the study, was a cheap and simple method which, without the need for expensive experimentation, was able to detect yield gaps and their causes in a region. The method can be used effectively in countries/regions where important yield gaps exist. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Enhanced efficiency nitrogen (N) fertilisers (EENFs) contain chemical urease or nitrification inhibitors, or physical barriers (e.g. polymer coating) to minimise the rapid build-up of nitrate (NO3 −) in soils. They have the potential to improve N use efficiency and lower N2O emissions from soils. However, evidence of the efficacy of EENFs in warm, wet subtropical conditions is lacking. We therefore developed N response curves (0, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 kg N ha-1) for urea, polymer coated urea (PCU), 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP)-urea (Entec®), N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT)-urea (Green urea®) and a carbon-coated urea (Black urea®) in subtropical, aerobic rice (Oryza sativa L) crops in two fields with contrasting soils (Gleysol and Histosol), and quantified N2O emissions from nil-N and 90 kg N ha-1 treatments for all EENFs and urea. In the Gleysol, cumulative in-crop N2O emissions were relatively high (approximately 2 kg N2O-N ha-1 season-1 with 90 kg N ha-1 applied) with no significant mitigation from any EENFs compared to urea. Grain yield data fitted with an exponential model indicated that 95% of the estimated maximum grain yield (6.8 t ha-1 at 14% moisture) was achieved with 81 kg N ha-1 for the urea treatment. The yield response curves for all tested EENF products did not differ significantly from the urea-N yield response curve. In the Histosol, cumulative in-crop N2O emissions were negligible (around 0.05 kg N2O-N ha-1 season-1), with no significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) between N fertiliser or nil-N treatments, and 95% of the estimated maximum grain yield (5.63 t ha-1 at 14% moisture) was achieved with only 11 kg N ha-1 for urea. There was no evidence that EENFs could achieve the maximum yield at a lower applied N rate. We hypothesised that the low soil pH of 4.9 (1:5 CaCl2 extract) may have inhibited nitrification in the Histosol, leading to low N2O emissions and a limited response to N fertiliser. Ultimately, the results of this study found no evidence that EENF products could improve agronomic N use efficiency or lower N2O emissions in the two aerobic rice crops studied. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - During the past few years, several studies have compared the performance of crop simulation models to assess the uncertainties in model-based climate change impact assessments and other modelling studies. Many of these studies have concentrated on cereal crops, while fewer model comparisons have been conducted for grasses. We compared the predictions for timothy grass (Phleum pratense L.) yields for first and second cuts along with the dynamics of above-ground biomass for the grass simulation models BASGRA and CATIMO, and the soil-crop model STICS. The models were calibrated and evaluated using field data from seven sites across Northern Europe and Canada with different climates, soil conditions and management practices. Altogether the models were compared using data on timothy grass from 33 combinations of sites, cultivars and management regimes. Model performances with two calibration approaches, cultivar-specific and generic calibrations, were compared. All the models studied estimated the dynamics of above-ground biomass and the leaf area index satisfactorily, but tended to underestimate the first cut yield. Cultivar-specific calibration resulted in more accurate first cut yield predictions than the generic calibration achieving root mean square errors approximately one third lower for the cultivar-specific calibration. For the second cut, the difference between the calibration methods was small. The results indicate that detailed soil process descriptions improved the overall model performance and the model responses to management, such as nitrogen applications. The results also suggest that taking the genetic variability into account between cultivars of timothy grass also improves the yield estimates. Calibrations using both spring and summer growth data simultaneously revealed that processes determining the growth in these two periods require further attention in model development. © 2018

AB  - Continuously flooded rice systems are a major contributor to global rice production and food security. Allowing the soil to dry periodically during the growing season (such as with alternate wetting and drying irrigation - AWD) has been shown to decrease methane emissions, water usage, and heavy metal accumulation in rice grain. However, the effects of AWD on rice yields are variable and not well understood. A two-year study was established to quantify the impacts of a range of treatments differing in AWD severity (degree of soil drying between flooding events) on yield (as well as factors that may affect yields), soil hydrology in the soil profile, and grain arsenic (As) concentrations relative to a continuously flooded control (CF). Three AWD treatments of increasing severity were imposed between full canopy cover (around 45 days after sowing) and 50% heading: AWD-Safe (field was reflooded when the perched water table reached 15 cm below the soil surface) and AWD35 and AWD25 (field was reflooded when the soil volumetric water content at 0–15 cm depth reached 35% and 25%, respectively). During the drying periods, the 0–15 cm soil layer in the AWD-Safe remained saturated, whereas in AWD35 and AWD25 the soil dried to the desired volumetric water contents. In contrast, soil moisture at 25–35 cm below the soil surface was similar across all treatments. Yield was not reduced in any of the AWD treatments, compared to the CF control. There were no consistent differences in yield components, 13C discrimination, and N dynamics. Results suggest that the availability of water and the presence of roots at the 25–35 cm soil depth during the drying periods ensured that the crop did not suffer drought stress and thus yields were maintained. Grain As concentration in the AWD-Safe treatment was similar to that in the CF control but decreased by 56–68% in AWD35 and AWD25. AWD-Safe is often promoted as a means of practicing AWD without reducing yields; however, in this study this practice did not reduce grain As concentration because the soil did not reach an unsaturated state. These findings demonstrate that knowledge of surface and subsurface hydrology, and the root system are important for understanding the potential of AWD. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - The frequency and intensity of extreme weather is increasing concomitant with changes in the global climate change. Although wheat is the most important food crop in Europe, there is currently no comprehensive empirical information available regarding the sensitivity of European wheat to extreme weather. In this study, we assessed the sensitivity of European wheat yields to extreme weather related to phenology (sowing, heading) in cultivar trials across Europe (latitudes 37.21° to 61.34° and longitudes −6.02° to 26.24°) during the period 1991–2014. All the observed agro-climatic extremes (≥31 °C, ≥35 °C, or drought around heading; ≥35 °C from heading to maturity; excessive rainfall; heavy rainfall and low global radiation) led to marked yield penalties in a selected set of European cultivars, whereas few cultivars were found to with no yield penalty in such conditions. There were no European wheat cultivars that responded positively (+10%) to drought after sowing, or frost during winter (−15 °C and −20 °C). Positive responses to extremes were often shown by cultivars associated with specific regions, such as good performance under high temperatures by southern-origin cultivars. Consequently, a major future breeding challenge will be to evaluate the potential of combining such cultivar properties with other properties required under different growing conditions with, for example, long day conditions at higher latitudes, when the intensity and frequency of extremes rapidly increase. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Impact of high temperature stress on crop growth and productivity is one key concern with respect to crop production and food security under climate change. Due to the complexity and diversity of crop characteristics and farmers’ management practices, as well as the difficulties in quantifying those agronomic management practices at reasonable temporal and spatial scales, crop responses to heat stress at a regional scale have not been properly assessed yet. In this study, we used remote-sensing data to investigate the responses of growth duration and leaf area index (LAI) of winter wheat to extreme high temperature during reproductive growing stage in the North China Plain from 2001 to 2008. Growing degree days above 0 °C (GDD) from heading to maturity was used to represent average temperature of growing environment, and the extreme temperature (>34 °C) degree days (EDD) was used as an indicator for heat stress. We detected statistically significant shortening of reproductive growing duration due to increase in GDD and EDD at both site and regional scales. We also found acceleration of leaf senescence under warmer environment, as well as considerable damages to leaf area by extremely high temperatures according to LAI values from remote-sensing data. Our results present the explicit patterns of crop responses to heat stress at different spatial scales and periods, indicating the complexity of the impacts of extreme events. Moreover, we highlighted that exposure, vulnerability and adaptation all should be considered in evaluating the impacts of extreme events. In addition, our findings suggest great potential for improving regional crop growth monitoring and yield prediction through assimilating remote-sensing data into mechanistic crop simulation models. © 2017

AB  - High-temperatures reduce yield of wheat and with global warming episodes of heat waves (only few days of high maximum temperatures) during grain filling will become more frequent. It has been recently reported that the magnitude of the yield penalties imposed by high temperatures under field conditions may interact with nitrogen (N) availability both in barley and maize. We determined, under field conditions, the penalties imposed by post-anthesis high-temperatures waves (increased maximum –but not minimum– temperatures during part of the grain filling period) on wheat yield under contrasting soil N supply during two consecutive years. The high temperature treatment was imposed for 10 d starting 10 d after anthesis by placing over the crops transparent polyethylene film (125 μm) mounted on wood structures of 1.5 m height above the ground. This high-temperature and the unheated controls were imposed on 5 modern and well adapted cultivars under contrasting N availabilities (376, 268 and 68 KgN ha−1). Averaged across N conditions, high-temperature treatments reduced yield by c. 1.5 Mg ha−1 (a loss of c. 17%) even though the treatment was rather mild in terms of different average temperature during grain filling. The magnitude of the loss was consistently shaped by the N condition in which the treatment was imposed: yield penalty produced by high-temperature increased from less than 1 to 2.6 Mg ha−1 (which represents losses from 10 to 25%) in parallel with the increased N supply. The penalties were related to both yield components (grain number and average grain weight) which also were more severely penalised under high than under low N supply. As episodes of high-temperature waves will become more frequent in the future the tools used to establish the needs of N fertilisation should be revised as the rates maximising yield (or gross margin) might induce higher sensitivities to these episodes. Also simulation models used to upscale physiological responses to regional or even global domains might need to be revised to include the effect of heat waves (which would be larger per °C increase than what is estimated from experiments increasing temperature during the whole day and over longer periods) as well as the interaction with N supply. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Red clover cultivation made significant contributions to soil fertility prior to the introduction of mineral nitrogen fertilizers. Its modern usage lies primarily in forage production, but reintegration into arable systems can enhance sustainability and preserve environmental integrity. Here we review red clovers nitrogen (N) contribution to subsequent crops, its capacity to fix N, and how this N is transferred to subsequent crops. The senescence of the root system following cultivation also contributes to soil organic matter, providing a suite of ecosystem services which are also reviewed. Potential contributions to allelopathic weed control and how this may be utilized to improve weed control is also discussed. Red clover varieties are diverse and can be split into categories of early/late flowering, erect/prostrate and diploid/tetraploid. This use of this diversity to different ends and purposes in fertility-building and the role of plant breeding in optimizing use of genetic resources is reviewed. Management strategies are also diverse; red clover can be grown in monoculture or with companion grasses, it can be harvested for forage or green manured (which can include or omit herbicides) and the consequence of this for soil fertility is discussed. High protein forage production is also a key benefit of red clover cultivation and the economic incentive this may provide to farmers is also reviewed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding the effect of genetic factors controlling flowering time is essential to fine-tune phenological development and to maximize yield. Thirty-four spring durum wheat genotypes classified in five allelic combinations for Ppd-A1/Ppd-B1 loci were grown for two years at three contrasting latitudes: Mexico-North, Spain-South and Spain-North. In all them, a delay in flowering date due to the presence of photoperiod sensitivity alleles Ppd-A1b and Ppd-B1b resulted in lower yields. The number of days to flowering, determined by an increasing number of photoperiod sensitivity alleles, accounted in all sites for more than 80% of the variation in the contribution of translocation of pre-flowering assimilates to grain yield. In Mexico and Spain-North late-flowering resulted in decreased harvest index as influenced by high temperatures during grain filling. In Mexico, where grain filling occurred under high temperatures and solar radiation, translocation of pre-flowering assimilates accounted from 55 to 63% of yield, independently of the flowering date of the genotype. In Spain-North, where water was available during grain filling, current photosynthesis was the main contributor to yield (57–73%), with independence of the allelic combination at Ppd loci. In Spain-South, the relative contribution of photosynthesis and translocation depended on the allelic composition at Ppd loci, with translocation increasing by 24% in the latest-flowering genotypes compared with the earliest ones. In all sites the limiting factor for attaining high yields was the capacity of the plant canopy to photosynthesize after anthesis. This study suggests that the expression of genes Ppd-A1 and Ppd-B1 regulating the response to photoperiod modulates the physiological strategy adopted by durum wheat to fill its grains, underlining the importance of phenology fitting in maximizing grain yield. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - High resource availability can reduce anti-herbivore resistance (a plant's ability to defend against herbivores and reduce damage) in rice, Oryza sativa L, but may also increase tolerance (a plant's ability to withstand damage by, for example, compensatory growth). Through a series of greenhouse, screenhouse and field experiments, this study examines fitness (survival and development × reproduction) of the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), on resistant (IR62) and susceptible (IR22) rice varieties and age-related rice tolerance to planthopper damage under varying resource (nitrogenous fertilizer) availability. Planthoppers reared on IR62 in the greenhouse had lower fitness than planthoppers on IR22. IR62 became increasingly resistant as plants aged. IR22 was generally more tolerant of planthopper damage, and tolerance increased in IR22, but declined in IR62, as the plants aged. Rice plants infested at pre-tillering stages (3–4 leaf stage) in the screenhouse had greater losses to root, shoot and grain yield per unit weight of planthopper than plants infested at tillering stages, particularly in IR22. These trends were mainly due to the impact of planthoppers during pre-tillering stages and the length of exposure to the planthoppers. High nitrogen compromised IR62 resistance, particularly in tillering plants in the greenhouse study; however, high nitrogen did not increase planthopper biomass-density on IR62 in greenhouse or field cages. Tolerance to damage in IR62 at mid-tillering stages declined under increasing levels of nitrogen, but nitrogen increased tolerance during late-tillering stages. Planthopper damage to IR22 in field cages was severe and hopperburn (plant death) occurred in 83% of IR22 plants under high nitrogen (60–150 kg N ha−1). In contrast, despite planthopper infestations, damage to IR62 was low in field-grown plants and productivity (tillers, roots, shoots and grain) increased in IR62 under increasing nitrogen. Our results indicate that, whereas nitrogenous fertilizer increases planthopper fitness on susceptible and resistant varieties, the net effects of high nitrogen on IR62 include decreased planthopper biomass-density (apparent in all experiments) and higher tolerance to damage during later growth stages (observed in the greenhouse, and during one of two seasons in field cages). © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Septoria tritici blotch (STB) is the most damaging disease of wheat crops in Europe. Because of the partial nature of genotypic resistance or the increasing resistance against fungicides, the tolerance, i.e. maintaining yield in the presence of expressed disease, is a relevant alternative. Tolerance is generally estimated through the yield loss per unit of source reduction, contrasts of tolerance between genotypes have been observed previously suggesting that either increasing the source availability or improving the use of stored assimilate could improve tolerance. This paper aims at developing a source/sink approach to understand the tolerance mechanism and identifying potential traits to increase tolerance of STB. A field experiment was designed to explore the relation between tolerance of STB and source/sink balance. Based on six wheat genotypes contrasting for tolerance exposed to natural STB epidemics, late nitrogen fertilization and a 50% spikelet removal were applied to change the source/sink balance. The tolerance of genotypes was quantitatively estimated over three additional field experiments. We found that STB tolerance was correlated with traits of healthy crops (high individual grain weight and high proportion of green leaf lamina area as leaf 3; flag leaf = leaf 1). The spikelet removal revealed a highly variable degree of source limitation for grain filling amongst the six genotypes. Thus, we proposed an easily calculated index that highly correlated positively with the labor intensive estimation of STB tolerance. Finally, potential yield and tolerance were not correlated, which suggests that breeding for yield performance and tolerance could be possible. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effects of supplemental nitrogen (N) on soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] seed yield have been the focus of much research over the past four decades. However, most experiments were region-specific and focused on the effect of a single N-related management choice, thus resulting in a limited inference space. Here, we composited data from individual experiments conducted across the US that examined the effect of N fertilization on soybean yield. The combined database included 207 environments (experiment × year combinations) for a total of 5991 N-treated soybean yields. We used hierarchical modeling and conditional inference tree analysis on the combined dataset to establish the relationship and contribution of several N management choices on soybean yield. The N treatment variables were: N-application (single or split), N-method (soil incorporated, foliar, etc.), N-timing (pre-plant, at a reproductive stage, etc.), and N-rate (from a 0 N control to as much as 560 kg ha−1). Of the total yield variability, 68% was associated with the effect of environment, whereas only a small fraction of that variability (&lt; 1%) was attributable to each N variable. Averaged over all experiments, a single N application and the split N application were 60 and 110 kg ha−1 greater yielding than the zero N control treatment, respectively. A split N application with more than one method (e.g., soil incorporated and foliar) resulted in 120 kg ha−1 greater yield than zero N plots. Split N application between planting and reproductive stages (Rn) resulted in greater yield than zero N and single application during a Rn; however, the effect was not significantly different than N application at other growth stages. Increasing the N rate increased the environment average soybean yield; however, 93% of the environment-specific N-rate responses were not significant which suggested a minimal effect of N across the examined region. A large yield variability was observed among environments within the same N rates, which was attributed to growing environment differences (e.g., in-season weather conditions, soil type etc.) and non-N related management (e.g., irrigation). Conditional inference tree analysis identified N-timing and N-rate to be conditional to irrigation, and to seeding rates &gt;420,000 seeds ha−1, indicating that N management decisions should take into account major, non-N related management practices. Overall, the analysis revealed that N management decisions had a measurable, but small, effect on soybean yield. Given the growing pressure for increasing food production, it is imperative to further examine all soybean N decisions (application method, timing, and rate) in environment- and cropping system-specific randomized trials in important agricultural regions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Most crop models have been developed with crops growing under full sunlight conditions and they commonly use daily cumulated global radiation as part of the climatic input data. This approach neglects the spatio-temporal dimension of the light reduction experienced by the crop in agroforestry systems. In this study, we evaluate the ability of the crop model STICS to predict winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) growth and yield under three distinct light conditions using field observations from a two year artificial shade experiment. The shade structure induced a continuous shade (CS) treatment characterized by a reduction of the proportion of light during the entire day and a periodic shade (PS) treatment defined by an intermittent shade varying on the plot throughout the day. These two shade conditions were compared to a no shade treatment (NS) receiving 100% of the available light. The model accurately predicted the timing of the grain maturity stage under the PS treatment by reducing the daily global radiation only. A correct prediction of this growth stage in the CS treatment required a decrease of the daily maximum air temperature in addition to the reduction of global radiation. Overall, the model accurately reproduces the total aboveground dry matter dynamics under the CS and NS treatments, but did not simulate the reduction observed under the PS treatment correctly. Three parameters (nbjgrain, cgrain and cgrainvo) involved in the determination of the number of grains have been calibrated with the NS treatment data and were then used to predict the crop behavior under the shaded treatments. Using this adjusted parameter set, the STICS model gave a good prediction of the grain number under all treatments. Nevertheless, the simulation of final grain yield under the shade treatments was not satisfactory yet, presumably due to an overestimation of the reallocation of the biomass between shoots and grains. Improving the prediction of these reallocation processes is challenging and critical to improve the simulation of crop behavior under fluctuating light environments such as encountered in agroforestry systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Land use conversion of row crops to bioenergy cropping systems in the southeastern United States (U.S.) creates concerns associated with water use and NO3-N leaching. Production of energy from biomass is associated with large amounts of byproducts generated during biofuel processing. Biochar and vinasse are two nutrient rich byproducts that could be land-applied to bioenergy crops to reduce reliance on synthetic fertilizer. However, effects on water dynamics of applying these byproducts to support biomass production is poorly understood, particularly when bioenergy crops replace traditional row crops. Thus, this study aimed to compare a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)-peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) rotation to sweet sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] receiving annual applications of biochar and vinasse, on biomass yield, crop evapotranspiration, water use efficiency (WUE), NO3-N leaching, and soil volumetric water content. A field study was conducted from 2013 to 2015 to assess the following treatments: cotton + 150 kg N ha−1 (COT), peanut + 30 kg N ha−1 (PEA), and sweet sorghum receiving one of the following i) 30 kg N ha−1 (S30); ii) 30 kg N ha−1 + biochar (S30B); iii) 30 kg N ha−1 + vinasse (S30V); and iv) 150 kg N ha−1 (S150). Similar aboveground dry matter yields were obtained in 2013 and 2015 for cotton and all sweet sorghum treatments and were on average 19 Mg ha−1 for both years. S30 and S150 achieved similar yields. Sweet sorghum and COT exhibited the highest WUE (∼5 g kg−1). S30B increased soil moisture retention at 0–0.2 m depth 36, 29, and 24% in 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively. Biochar incorporated at 0.15 m soil depth increased soil moisture retention down to 0.4 m. Low N rate application combined with biochar in S30B could represent an alternative management practice to minimize N leaching, recycle nutrients, and increase soil water retention if sweet sorghum were to be widely adopted by farmers in the southeastern U.S. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Wheat is a major staple food crop providing about 20% of dietary energy and proteins, and food products made of whole grain wheat are a major source of micronutrients like Zinc (Zn), Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Magnesium (Mg), Vitamin B and E. Wheat provides about 40% intake of essential micronutrients by humans in the developing countries relying on wheat based diets. Varieties with genetically enhanced levels of grain micronutrient concentrations can provide a cost-effective and sustainable option to resource poor wheat consumers. To determine the effects of commonly deployed dwarfing genes on wheat grain Zn, Fe, Mn and Mg concentrations, nine bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) and six durum wheat (T. turgidum) isoline pairs differing for Rht1 (= Rht-B1b) and one bread wheat pair for Rht2 (= Rht-D1b) dwarfing genes were evaluated for three crop seasons at N.E. Borlaug Research Station, Cd. Obregon, Sonora, Mexico. Presence of dwarfing genes have significantly reduced grain Zn concentration by 3.9 ppm (range 1.9-10.0 ppm), and Fe by 3.2 ppm (range 1.0-14.4 ppm). On the average, about 94 ppm Mg and 6 ppm Mn reductions occurred in semidwarf varieties compared to tall varieties. The thousand kernel weight (TKW) of semidwarf isolines was 2.6 g (range 0.7-5.6 g) lower than the tall counterparts whereas the plant height decreased by 25 cm (range 16–37 cm). Reductions for all traits in semidwarfs were genotype dependent and the magnitude of height reductions did not correlate with reductions in micronutrient concentrations in wheat grain. We conclude that increased grain yield potential of semidwarf wheat varieties is associated with reduced grain micronutrient concentrations; however, the magnitude of reductions in micronutrients varied depending on genetic background and their associated pleiotropic effect on yield components. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Large variability in crop responses to macronutrient application at various spatial scales present challenges for developing effective fertilizer recommendations for crop production in smallholder farming systems of sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed maize yield responses to nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) application and evaluated relationships between crop responses to N, P and K application and soil analysis data. Nutrient omission trials were conducted on 23 farms located in Sidindi, Western Kenya, selected to be representative of the main soil and management factors in maize based systems in Siaya County. Treatments included a control and PK, NK, NP and NPK applications. The trials ran for six consecutive cropping seasons, without changing treatments or plot location, covering the period 2013–2015. Strong spatial-temporal patterns in maize yield responses to N, P and K applications were observed. Average maize yields in the control, PK, NK, NP and NPK treatments were 2.8, 3.2, 5.1, 5.1 and 5.5 t ha−1 at 88% dry matter respectively in the first cropping season, and 1.1, 1.4, 2.9, 3.6 and 5.3 t ha−1 at 88% dry matter respectively in the sixth cropping season. In all seasons, variability in maize yield between fields was greatest in the control treatment followed by the NK treatment and least in the NPK treatment. Mean relative yield was 0.6, 0.92 and 0.93 for N, P and K respectively, in the first cropping season, and 0.25, 0.52 and 0.68, respectively, in the sixth cropping season. Six main maize yield response categories were identified that differed in the maize grain yield responses to recursive N, P and K applications. Maize yield responses to N, P and K were not fully accounted for by soil organic matter, soil available P and exchangeable K respectively. Our results indicate that current methods for soil analysis do not adequately predict the response to application of N, P and K fertilizer under the highly variable soil fertility conditions encountered in smallholder farming systems. The strong spatial-temporal patterns observed present major challenges for the development of effective site-specific fertilizer recommendations. Potential avenues for future research and options for more effective intensification strategies are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) breeders over the past century have increased the productivity and resilience of this crop via strong selection applied to genes controlling agronomically important traits. Along this process, some of the primitive genetic diversity of this species was lost. A debate exists on whether or not some of the original primitive diversity should be re-introgress into modern germplasm in order to facilitate new improvements. Here, the possible negative effects of re-introducing primitive diversity were assessed by comparing the performances of three ICARDA elites and four commercial cultivars against seventeen durum wheat wide crosses, generated by hybridization of elites and Triticum dicoccoides, T. araraticum, and Aegilops speltoides. The material was grown in Lebanon, Algeria and 10 environments in Morocco. Tested under natural inoculation against Lr14a virulent strains of leaf rust as well as tan spot races 4 and 6, revealed that wide crosses had significantly higher levels of resistance. Further, the use of a selection index that combined selection for grain yield potential and stability revealed that 14 wide crosses performed better than any of the elites or cultivars. Finally, testing quality traits at four sites revealed that wide crosses had significantly higher grain size and protein content than the other two germplasm classes, while no significant difference could be observed for gluten strength. Only in the case of yellow pigment, an industrially important trait for durum wheat, one variety (‘Tomouh’) outperformed all other classes, even though wide crosses lines also achieved good scores. Hence, it was not possible to identify any negative drag in the use of wide crosses for improving durum wheat modern germplasm, with the partial exception of yellow pigment. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata [L.] Walp.) is an important but under-studied grain legume which can potentially contribute to improved dietary zinc (Zn) intake in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, surveys were conducted on smallholder farms in Zimbabwe during 2014/15 to determine the influence of diverse soil fertility management options on cowpea grain productivity and nutrition quality. Guided by the surveys, field experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of Zn fertilizer on the productivity and quality of cowpea under integrated soil fertility management (ISFM). Experiments were conducted on two soil-types, namely, sandy (6% clay) and red clay (57% clay) in 2014/15 and 2015/16 where cowpea was grown in rotation with staple maize (Zea mays L.) and fertilized with combinations of Zn, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and two organic nutrient resources, cattle manure and woodland leaf litter. Cowpea grain yields on surveyed farms ranged from 0.3 to 0.9 t ha−1, with grain Zn concentration ranging from 23.9 to 30.1 mg kg−1. The highest grain Zn concentration was on fields where organic nutrient resources were applied in combination with mineral N and P fertilizers. Within the field experiments, mean grain yields of cowpea increased by between 12 and 18% on both soil types when Zn fertilizer was applied, from a baseline of 1.6 and 1.1 t ha−1 on red clay and sandy soils, respectively. When Zn fertilizer was co-applied with organic nutrient resources, grain Zn concentrations of cowpea reached 42.1 mg kg−1 (red clay) and 44.7 mg kg−1 (sandy) against grain Zn concentrations of 35.9 mg kg−1 and 31.1 mg kg−1 measured in cowpea grown with no Zn fertilizer on red clay and sandy soils, respectively. Agronomic biofortification of legumes is feasible and has the potential to contribute significantly towards increasing dietary Zn intake by humans. A greater increase in grain Zn of cowpea grown on sandy than red clay soils under Zn fertilization illustrates the influence of soil type on Zn uptake, which should be explored further in agronomic biofortification programs. © 2017

AB  - Water shortage and unbalanced precipitation distribution are major problems threatening agricultural sustainability, especially winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production, in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain of China, and water-saving cultivation with limited irrigation is a promising technique in this region. An eight-year field study was conducted in this region from 2007 to 2015, with the same water and fertilizer management used in the sowing stage of winter wheat, which then received supplemental irrigation (SI) or no irrigation (rain-fed). The proportion of water consumption from jointing to maturity averaged 56% under rain-fed conditions, but reached 64% under the optimal SI conditions. The main water supply during the different growth periods that was suitable for achieving both high yield and high water use efficiency (WUE) had a nearly constant volume. The optimal seasonal SI amount decreased with an increasing natural water supply throughout the growing season, and its contributions to the seasonal evapotranspiration ranged from 11% to 44%. Significant regression relationships were observed among the main water supply at sowing, precipitation in different growth stages and rain-fed grain yield and between the optimal SI amounts needed from sprouting to jointing or from sprouting to anthesis and the rain-fed grain yield. These results provide important theoretical and technical support for on-demand irrigation by model forecasting. The results also indicated SI, as determined by simultaneously considering the precipitation change, soil water storage condition, and crop evapotranspiration status, is an important way to achieve high yield and conserve water in winter wheat. © 2017 The Author

AB  - As soybean yield continues to increase, it seems critical to know if there is a yield level at which potential contribution of indigenous nitrogen (N) sources (N fixation and soil mineralization) becomes insufficient to meet crop N requirements for high yields, while still maintaining or increasing protein and oil concentration. We have hypothesized that, in absence of other limiting factors, degree of N limitation increases with increasing yield potential (Yp) of the production environment. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel protocol to ensure an ample N supply during the entire crop season (full-N treatment). That protocol was applied to field-grown irrigated soybean in Balcarce (Argentina) and Nebraska (USA), where measured full-N seed yields were ±15% of their simulated Yp in 92% of the cases. The combination of locations, years, sowing dates, and N treatments resulted in a wide range of seed yields, from 2.5 to 6.5 Mg ha−1. Overall, full-N seed yield averaged 11% higher than seed yield without N addition (zero-N). However, magnitude of yield difference between full-N and zero-N depended upon Yp, ranging from no detectable yield difference in low-Yp (ca. 2.5 Mg ha−1) to up to 900 kg ha−1 in high-Yp environments (ca. 6 Mg ha−1). Seed yield differences were associated with higher aboveground dry matter, seed number, and seed weight in the full-N versus zero-N treatments. Seed protein (but not oil) concentration was higher in the full-N treatment, and both protein and oil yields were higher in the full-N versus zero-N treatments. Findings from this study indicate that (i) N limits soybean seed yield (as well as protein yield, and oil yield) in environments with high Yp, where indigenous N sources seem insufficient to fully satisfy crop N requirements, and (ii) yield response to N fertilizer can occur above a 2.5 Mg ha−1 Yp threshold and has an upper limit of 250 kg seed per Mg increase in Yp. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Frost, during reproductive developmental stages, especially post head emergence frost (PHEF), can result in catastrophic yield loss for wheat producers. Breeding for improved PHEF tolerance may allow greater yield to be achieved, by (i) reducing direct frost damage and (ii) facilitating earlier crop sowing to reduce the risk of late-season drought and/or heat stress. This paper provides an economic feasibility analysis of breeding options for PHEF tolerant wheat varieties. It compares the economic benefit to growers with the cost of a wheat breeding program aimed at developing PHEF tolerant varieties. The APSIM wheat model, with a frost-impact and a phenology gene-based module, was employed to simulate direct and indirect yield benefits for various levels of improved frost tolerance. The economic model considers optimal profit, based on sowing date and nitrogen use, rather than achieving maximum yield. The total estimated fixed cost of breeding program was AUD 1293 million, including large scale seed production to meet seed demand, with AUD 1.2 million year−1 to run breeding program after advanced development and large scale field experiments. The results reveal that PHEF tolerant varieties would lead to a significant increase in economic benefits through reduction in direct damage and an increase in yield through early sowing. The economic benefits to growers of up to AUD 4841 million could be realised from growing PHEF tolerant lines if useful genetic variation can be found. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the benefits are particularly sensitive to increases in fixed costs, seed replacement, discount rate, and to delays in variety release. However, the investment still remains viable for most tested scenarios. Based on comparative economic benefits, if breeders were able to develop PHEF tolerant varieties that could withstand cold temperatures −4 °C below the current damage threshold, there is very little further economic value of breeding total frost tolerant varieties. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - ORYZA version 3, as the successor to ORYZA2000, is an ecophysiological model that can simulate rice growth and development for targeted yield with different nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates and planting densities in a given rice production system. Currently, there is little published information on the application of ORYZA (v3) and ORYZA2000 in simulating high-yielding rice cultivars under different N rates and planting density schemes in central China. This paper combines field experimentation with ORYZA (v3) to calibrate the crop growth characteristics of widely grown high-yielding inbred and hybrid rice cultivars. The calibrated model was applied to simulate yields under different N rates, planting densities, and seedlings per hill, using historical weather data from 1986 to 2015. ORYZA (v3) reliably simulated the dynamics of crop biomass and leaf area index, and seasonal yield, with relatively small normalized root mean square error (RMSEn) and high adjusted linear correlation coefficient (R2), but slightly over-estimated leaf N concentration. Scenario analyses indicated that the maximum differences in simulated yields were 72.1 kg ha−1 due to planting density, 112.8 kg ha−1 due to seedlings per hill, and 3266.2 kg ha−1 due to N rates. The simulations demonstrated that further field experiments are crucial in investigating the effects of rice genotype, N management and their interactions on yield for optimal crop management. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Remote sensing has gained much attention for agronomic applications such as crop management or yield estimation. Crop phenotyping under field conditions has recently become another important application that requires specific needs: the considered remote-sensing method must be (1) as accurate as possible so that slight differences in phenotype can be detected and related to genotype, and (2) robust so that thousands of cultivars potentially quite different in terms of plant architecture can be characterized with a similar accuracy over different years and soil and weather conditions. In this study, the potential of nadir and off-nadir ground-based spectro-radiometric measurements to remotely sense five plant traits relevant for field phenotyping, namely, the leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen contents, and canopy chlorophyll and nitrogen contents, was evaluated over fourteen sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) cultivars, two years and three study sites. Among the diversity of existing remote-sensing methods, two popular approaches based on various selected Vegetation Indices (VI) and PROSAIL inversion were compared, especially in the perspective of using them for phenotyping applications. Overall, both approaches are promising to remotely estimate LAI and canopy chlorophyll content (RMSE ≤ 10%). In addition, VIs show a great potential to retrieve canopy nitrogen content (RMSE = 10%). On the other hand, the estimation of leaf-level quantities is less accurate, the best accuracy being obtained for leaf chlorophyll content estimation based on VIs (RMSE = 17%). As expected when observing the relationship between leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen contents, poor correlations are found between VIs and mass-based or area-based leaf nitrogen content. Importantly, the estimation accuracy is strongly dependent on sun-sensor geometry, the structural and biochemical plant traits being generally better estimated based on nadir and off-nadir observations, respectively. Ultimately, a preliminary comparison tends to indicate that, providing that enough samples are included in the calibration set, (1) VIs provide slightly more accurate performances than PROSAIL inversion, (2) VIs and PROSAIL inversion do not show significant differences in robustness across the different cultivars and years. Even if more data are still necessary to draw definitive conclusions, the results obtained with VIs are promising in the perspective of high-throughput phenotyping using UAV-embedded multispectral cameras, with which only a few wavebands are available. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biochar has been shown to reduce soil emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O in short-term incubation and greenhouse experiments. Such controlled experiments failed to represent variable field conditions, and rarely included crop growth feedback. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of biochar, in comparison to green manure and mineral nitrogen, on greenhouse gas Emissions Intensity (EI = emissions in CO2 equivalents per ton of grain yield) in a low-fertility tropical Ultisol. Using a field trial in western Kenya, biochar (0 and 2.5 t ha−1; made from Eucalyptus wood) was integrated with urea (0 and 120 kg N ha−1) and green manure (Tithonia diversifolia; 0, 2.5 and 5 t ha−1) in a factorial design for four consecutive seasons from October 2012 to August 2014. Compared to the control, biochar increased soil CO2 emissions (9–33%), reduced soil CH4 uptake (7–59%) and reduced soil N2O emissions (1–42%) in each season, with no seasonal differences. N2O emissions increased following amendment with T. diversifolia (6%) and urea (13%) compared to the control. Generally, N2O emissions decreased where only biochar was applied. The greatest decrease in N2O (42%) occurred where all three amendments were applied compared to when they were added separately. EI in response to any of the amendments was lower than the control, ranging from 9 to 65% (33.0 ± 3.2 = mean ± SE). The amendments increased SOC stocks by 0.1–1.2 t ha−1 year−1 (mean ± SE of 0.8 ± 0.09 t ha−1 year−1). The results suggest decreased net EI with biochar in low fertility soils mainly through greater net primary productivity (89% of the decrease). © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Across the Australian wheat belt, the time at which wheat flowers is a critical determinant of yield. In all environments an optimal flowering period (OFP) exists which is defined by decreasing frost risk, and increasing water and heat stress. Despite their critical importance, OFPs have not been comprehensively defined across south eastern Australia's (SEA) cropping zone using yield estimates incorporating temperature, radiation and water-stress. In this study, the widely validated cropping systems model APSIM was used to simulate wheat yield and flowering date, with reductions in yield applied for frost and heat damage based on air temperatures during sensitive periods. Simulated crops were sown at weekly intervals from April 1 to July 15 of each year. The relationship between flowering date and grain yield was established for 28 locations using 51-years (1963–2013) of climate records. We defined OFPs as the flowering period which was associated with a mean yield of ≥ 95% of maximum yield from the combination of 51 seasons and 16 sowing dates. OFPs for wheat in SEA varied with site and season and the relative importance of seasonal water supply and demand and extremes of temperature in defining the window also varied. Quantifying OFPs will be a vital first step to identify suitable genotype x sowing date combinations to maximise yield in different locations, particularly given recent and predicted regional climate shifts including the decline in autumn rainfall. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The increasing pig population in northeast Spain and the need to adequately manage the pig slurry (PS) generated demand the inclusion of PS in crop fertilisation plans. The aim of the present study was to maximise the amount of PS that can be applied to the crops without adverse environmental effects. Thus, a 3-year experiment was established to evaluate the response of flooded rice to different fertilisation strategies. The fertilisation strategies tested were two rates of PS applied before sowing: 170 kg NH4-N ha−1 (PS170 strategy) that would cover the entire rice N requirements and 120 kg NH4-N ha−1 (PS120 strategy) that would theoretically require N as top-dressing to reach maximum yields. These strategies were compared to the rate of mineral fertiliser applied before sowing at 120 kg NH4-N ha−1. Plant density; the presence of weeds, pests and diseases; head rice yield; and rice quality were not affected by the N source (PS or mineral). Maximum rice yields (5567–8235 kg ha−1) varied between years and were attained with the two PS fertilisation strategies. Maximum yields with the PS170 strategy were reached without top-dressing application in the three years, but nitrogen (N) as top-dressing was necessary to reach maximum yields with the PS120 strategy. The nitrogen fertiliser replacement value (NFRV) of the two PS strategies, 87% (PS170) and 96% (PS120) of ammonium N applied, were not significantly different. The high PS NFRV suggests that PS is an excellent N source and rates should be established considering PS ammonium N content. Agronomic and recovery N use efficiencies and unaccounted N were not significantly different between mineral and PS strategies when the same ammonium N rate was applied; however, when the total N was considered, N use efficiencies decreased, indicating that organic N is not taken up by the crop during the crop season. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - To explore the potential utilization of Rht4 in wheat improvement, we investigated and compared the effects of Rht4 and Rht-B1b on the plant height and yield components using four groups of recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross between “IDO444” (tall, no known dwarfing alleles) and “Rio Blanco” (semi-dwarf, Rht4 + Rht-B1b) grown under two water regimes. Rht4, Rht-B1b and Rht4 + Rht-B1b significantly reduced plant height by 11.5%, 19.3% and 18.2%, respectively. There were no additive effects on plant height in Rht4 + Rht-B1b lines. Both Rht4 and Rht-B1b significantly reduced internode length and lodging score with stronger effects by Rht-B1b. Water stress affected the plant height related traits of the single Rht-B1b lines more than that of the Rht4 lines, except for distance from spike to flag leaf ligule. Grain number was increased by Rht4 and Rht-B1b, but higher spike numbers was only observed in lines with Rht-B1b. Both Rht4 and Rht-B1b significantly reduced thousand kernels weight. Rht-B1b reduced above-ground biomass but increased grain yield and harvest index, while Rht4 had less effect on these traits, compared with tall lines under both well-watered and water-stressed conditions. The Rht4 + Rht-B1b lines produced the highest yield under both water regimes, with more grain number, greater spike number and higher harvest index. In conclusion, Rht4 did not show advantages over Rht-B1b on grain yield, but Rht4 + Rht-B1b did, in both water regimes, which suggests that Rht4 should be combined with Rht-B1b in wheat improvement. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Abating large losses of nitrogen (N) oxides while maintaining or enhancing crop yield is a major goal in irrigated maize (Zea mays L) cropping areas. During two consecutive campaigns, the new nitrification inhibitor 2-(3,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl) succinic acid isomeric mixture (DMPSA) applied with calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) and the same fertilizer applied by drip-fertigation without the inhibitor, were evaluated and compared with CAN broadcast to the surface and irrigated with sprinklers. Concurrently, urea-based treatments such as urea-fertigation and the broadcast application of urea combined with sprinkler irrigation, with or without the urease inhibitor N-butyl thiophosphorictriamide (NBPT), were also assessed. Nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) fluxes, grain and biomass yield and yield-scaled N2O emissions of the different treatments were compared. Additionally, methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were measured. On average, fertigation treatments led to a mitigation of N2O emissions with respect to sprinkler irrigation by 80% and 78% for CAN and urea, respectively. With regards to inhibitor-based strategies, the use of DMPSA and NBPT reduced N2O losses by 58% and 51%, respectively, considering the average of both maize cropping seasons. Since no differences in grain yield were observed between fertilized treatments, DMPSA and fertigation treatments gave the lowest values of yield-scaled N2O emissions, leading to reductions of 63%, 71% and 78% for CAN with DMPSA, urea-fertigation and CAN-fertigation, respectively, with respect to conventional management strategies (surface broadcast application and sprinkler irrigation). Low NO emissions during the first campaign masked differences between treatments, whereas during the second season, NO losses significantly decreased in the following order: conventional treatments &gt; inhibitors &gt; fertigation. Comparing conventional management practices, CAN significantly decreased emissions of N oxides compared with urea, but this effect was only observed in the second maize cropping season. The moisture distribution pattern in drip plots (dry and wet areas) caused a reduction of CH4 sink (only in one of the two seasons) and respiration fluxes, in comparison to sprinkler. This study shows that the use of the new nitrification inhibitor DMPSA and drip-fertigation should be promoted in irrigated maize agro-ecosystems, in order to mitigate emissions of N oxides without penalizing grain yield and leading to similar or enhanced biomass production. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although the U.S. southern Great Plains accounts for approximately 30% of total U.S. wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production, yields in the region have rarely surpassed 3.0 Mg ha−1 and quantification of the wheat yield gap (YG) and meteorological factors associated with potential wheat productivity are scarce. Our objectives were to identify spatial gradients in key weather variables and to assess the meteorological drivers of wheat productivity and resource-use efficiency, and to quantify the wheat YG across Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, and Kansas. Water-limited wheat grain yield (Yw) was simulated for 30 consecutive years at 68 locations across the southern Great Plains using Simple Simulation Modeling-Wheat (SSM-Wheat), and actual soil and weather data, sowing date, and population density. Regional gradients in meteorological variables were determined for (i) the entire crop cycle, (ii) pre- and post-anthesis, or (iii) jointing-anthesis interval, and Yw were related back to these variables using linear and stepwise multiple-regression. Boundary function analysis determined water productivity (WP) and transpiration-use efficiency (TE). Strong latitudinal gradients occurred for temperatures and longitudinal gradients for precipitation (P), evapotranspirative demand (ETo), and solar radiation (Rs). Wheat Yw averaged 5.2 Mg ha−1 and followed the longitudinal P gradient increasing from west (3.6 Mg ha−1) to east (6.9 Mg ha−1). Interannual Yw variability was large with coefficient of variation (CV) increasing from 13 to 51% east to west. Meteorological variables accounting for major portions of the Yw variability were water supply (P + PAWs) in the west [82% of regression sums of squares (SS)] and cumulative solar radiation (Rs) during the anthesis − physiological maturity in the east (73% of SS). Temperatures during the anthesis-physiological maturity phase negatively affected grain yields across all locations and years (7% of SS). Wheat WP (17.2 kg ha−1 mm−1) and TE (20.8 kg ha−1 mm−1) benchmarks derived in this study align well with values reported for wheat grown in other regions of the world. © 2016

AB  - Tillage and N fertilization strategies including mineral and organic sources need to be studied in combination given their importance on the production cost that farmers face and their potential interaction on crop performance. A four-year (2010–2014) experiment based on barley monocropping was carried out in NE Spain in a typical rainfed Mediterranean area. Two tillage treatments (CT, conventional tillage; NT, no-tillage) and three rates of N fertilization (0; 75 kg N ha−1, applied at top-dressing; 150 kg N ha−1, applied at pre-sowing and at top-dressing at equal rate), with two types of fertilizers (ammonium-based mineral fertilizer and organic fertilizer with pig slurry), were compared in a randomized block design with three replications. Different soil (water and nitrate contents) and crop (above-ground biomass, grain yield, yield components and N concentration in biomass and grain) measurements were performed. Water- and nitrogen use efficiencies (WUE and NUE) as well as other N-related indexes (grain and above-ground biomass N uptake; NHI, nitrogen harvest index; NAR, apparent nitrogen recovery efficiency) were calculated. Barley above-ground biomass and grain yield were highly variable and depended on the rainfall received on each cropping season (ranging between 280 mm and 537 mm). Tillage and N fertilization treatments affected barley grain yields. No-tillage showed 1.0, 1.7 and 6.3 times greater grain yield than CT in three of the four cropping seasons as a result of the greater soil water storage until tillering. Water scarcity during the definition of the number of spikes per m2 under CT would have compromised the compensation mechanism of the other two yield components. Pig slurry application led to the same (3 of 4 years) or higher (1 of 4 years) grain yield than an equivalent rate of mineral N fertilizer. Regardless the N origin, barley yield did not respond to the application of 150 kg N ha−1 split between pre-sowing and top-dressing compared to the 75 kg N ha−1 rate applied as top-dressing. A significant nitrate accumulation in the soil over the experimental period was observed under CT. Greater barley water use efficiency for yield (WUEy), N uptake and grain N content were found under NT than CT in three of the four cropping seasons studied. Moreover, for a given N rate, the use of organic fertilization increased significantly the WUEy as an average of CT and NT. When CT was used, a greater NHI was observed when using pig slurry compared with mineral N as an average of the four years studied. However, the use of different N fertilization treatments (rates or types) under CT or NT did not increase the NUE compared with the control. Our study demonstrates that the use of NT and the application of agronomic rates of N as pig slurry leads to greater barley yield and water- and nitrogen-use efficiencies than the traditional management based on CT and mineral N fertilization. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) yield response to nitrogen (N) application has been well documented, but the temporal dynamics of N accumulation and partitioning by sesame are poorly understood. Such knowledge is needed to better inform fertilization decisions and improve N use efficiency (NUE). The objective of this study was to characterize N and biomass accumulation, partitioning, and remobilization among diverse sesame cultivars grown in the humid southeastern USA. A two-year field study was conducted at the University of Florida Plant Science Research and Education Unit in Citra, Florida in 2013 and 2014. Four commercially available cultivars (S30, S32, S36, and S39) with variable maturity and branching characteristics were sampled at multiple growth stages and divided into vegetative (stalks plus leaves), reproductive (capsules plus seed), and root (only S30 and S36) components to determine biomass and N accumulation. Medium-maturing cultivars (S30 and S32) reached peak aboveground biomass accumulation at late-bloom stage and accumulated ∼5100 kg biomass ha−1 by dry down, while peak aboveground biomass accumulation for late-maturing cultivars (S36 and S39) was reached at physiological maturity and amounted to 8242–8739 kg biomass ha−1 at dry down. Cultivars reached peak N accumulation at mid-bloom (S30), late-bloom (S32 and S39), and physiological maturity (S36). Total N accumulated by cultivars ranged from70 to 99 kg N ha−1 in aboveground biomass, of which 33–60% was taken up during the reproductive growth phase. It was also estimated that 31–66% of aboveground vegetative N was remobilized to capsules and seed during reproductive growth. Root N accumulation peaked at mid-bloom stage, at which point S30 and S36 had accumulated approximately 4 kg N ha−1. Removal of N with harvested seed amounted to 29–49 kg N ha−1, with S36 removing more total N with harvest than both medium-maturing cultivars. This pattern of N accumulation suggests that plant available N has the potential to impact sesame reproductive nutrient allocation, but additional research is needed to determine if the impact of the timing of N fertilization differs among more diverse sesame maturity classes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To improve climate change impact estimates and to quantify their uncertainty, multi-model ensembles (MMEs) have been suggested. Model improvements can improve the accuracy of simulations and reduce the uncertainty of climate change impact assessments. Furthermore, they can reduce the number of models needed in a MME. Herein, 15 wheat growth models of a larger MME were improved through re-parameterization and/or incorporating or modifying heat stress effects on phenology, leaf growth and senescence, biomass growth, and grain number and size using detailed field experimental data from the USDA Hot Serial Cereal experiment (calibration data set). Simulation results from before and after model improvement were then evaluated with independent field experiments from a CIMMYT world-wide field trial network (evaluation data set). Model improvements decreased the variation (10th to 90th model ensemble percentile range) of grain yields simulated by the MME on average by 39% in the calibration data set and by 26% in the independent evaluation data set for crops grown in mean seasonal temperatures >24 °C. MME mean squared error in simulating grain yield decreased by 37%. A reduction in MME uncertainty range by 27% increased MME prediction skills by 47%. Results suggest that the mean level of variation observed in field experiments and used as a benchmark can be reached with half the number of models in the MME. Improving crop models is therefore important to increase the certainty of model-based impact assessments and allow more practical, i.e. smaller MMEs to be used effectively. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Maintaining grain quality of wheat under climate change is critical for human nutrition, end-use functional properties, as well as commodity value. This paper reviews the current knowledge of high temperature and elevated atmospheric CO2 on whole-grain and functional properties of wheat. It also considers the utility of contemporary crop models for investigating the impacts of climate change on wheat quality; and discusses opportunities for advancing model capability. Under elevated CO2 wheat yield can increase by up to 36%, but universally grain protein concentration decreases and a shift in composition translates to reduced functional properties. High temperature during the post-anthesis period of crops can cause a step change reduction in grain-set, grain size and milling yield. Numerous crop models including APSIM-Nwheat, CropSyst, Sirius, GLAM-HTS account for high CO2 effects through modification of RUE, TE or critical leaf-N concentration and high temperature by accelerated leaf senescence, grain number, potential grain weight or HI modifications. For grain quality, however, crop models are typically restricted to predicting average grain size and grain-N content (concentration), although the SiriusQuality model accounts for the major storage proteins, gliadin and glutenin. For protein composition, high temperature stress reduces the glutenin/gliadin ratio and limits the synthesis of the larger SDS-insoluble glutenin polymers which causes wheat dough to have weaker viscoelasticity properties. This link provides an opportunity to model high temperature effects on grain functional properties. Further development and testing, utilizing grain quality data from global FACE programmes will be particularly valuable for validating and enhancing the performance of such models. For whole-grain characteristics, a single-spike model approach, which accounts for intra-spike variation in assimilate deposition may provide an opportunity to predict grain size distribution and associated screenings percentage and milling yield. Taken together expanding the predictive capability of our crop models to grain quality is an important step in providing a powerful tool for developing adaptation strategies for combating the impacts of climate change to global crop production and grain quality. © 2015

AB  - Lignocellulosic biofuels, such as those produced from crop residues, offer the possibility of reducing GHG emissions in the transport sector. Wheat straw is one potential feedstock for these fuels but grain yield has been prioritised over straw yield in crop breeding as straw currently has limited value. Should a new market for straw develop then dual-purpose cultivars (DPCs) that are optimised for food and bioenergy may become desirable. Field experiments were used to assess four key traits – grain yield, straw yield, lodging resistance and straw saccharification potential (i.e. the biofuel yield) – of a selection of modern and older UK wheat cultivars (with release dates ranging from 1964 to 2010) with the aim of identifying dual-purpose cultivars and any trade-offs among the key traits. None of the cultivars assessed were outstanding candidates for use as DPCs. Among the semi-dwarf cultivars there were only minor relationships between traits; including the non-semi-dwarf cultivar showed trade-offs between grain and straw yields. The findings suggest that selecting from among currently grown cultivars offers limited possibility for growing truly DPCs. However, the results indicate that high straw yields can be achieved by selecting high grain-yielding cultivars and managing these to maximise grain yield. Plant growth regulators should continue to be used as these do not significantly reduce straw yields but do decrease lodging susceptibility. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Despite the routine collection of annual agricultural surveys and significant advances in GIS and remote sensing products, little econometric research has integrated these data sources in estimating developing nations’ agricultural yields. In this paper, we explore the determinants of wheat output per hectare in Ethiopia during the 2011–2013 principal Meher crop seasons at the kebele administrative area. Using a panel data approach, combining national agricultural field surveys with relevant GIS and remote sensing products, the model explains nearly 40% of the total variation in wheat output per hectare across the country. Reflecting on the high interannual variability in output per hectare, we explore whether these changes can be explained by weather, shocks to, and management of rain-fed agricultural systems. The model identifies specific contributors to wheat yields that include farm management techniques (e.g. area planted, improved seed, fertilizer, and irrigation), weather (e.g. rainfall), water availability (e.g. vegetation and moisture deficit indexes) and policy intervention. Our findings suggest that woredas produce between 9.8 and 86.5% of their locally attainable wheat yields given their altitude, weather conditions, terrain, and plant health. In conclusion, we believe the combination of field surveys with spatial data can be used to identify management priorities for improving production at a variety of administrative levels. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - Intercropping is a promising model for ecological intensification of modern agriculture. Little information is available on how species growth patterns are affected by size-asymmetric above- and belowground competitive interactions, especially in intercrops with more than two species. We studied plant growth and competitive interactions in a novel intercropping system with three species: wheat, watermelon and maize. Wheat and maize are grown sequentially (as a double cropping system) in narrow strips while watermelon is grown between the cereal strips, with partial overlap in growing period with the two cereals. Growth patterns were monitored over two years and described with logistic growth curves. Root barriers were used to study the effect of belowground interactions. Wheat produced 31% greater yield per plant in the intercrop than in the sole crop but 24% lower yield per unit total (inter)crop area. Wheat yield increase per plant was associated with faster growth and substantial overyielding in the outer rows of wheat strips. Watermelon did not competitively affect wheat. Watermelon biomass was substantially reduced at the time of wheat harvest. However, compensatory growth after wheat harvest and greater allocation to fruits resulted in a good yield of intercropped watermelon, 92% of monoculture yields, at final harvest. Intercropped maize produced 32% lower grain yield per plant and per unit area than sole maize, as a consequence of later sowing and a changed plant configuration in the intercrop as compared to the sole crop, and competitive effects of watermelon, as shown by comparison with a skip-row maize system without watermelon. Root barriers did not affect yield of any of the species, indicating that aboveground competitive interactions in this case played a more important role in shaping the observed growth responses than belowground interactions. Plant interactions in this tripartite intercrop system are consistent with the hypothesis of size-asymmetric competition for light. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is of great interest to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeders because it addresses the daunting prospect of feeding the burgeoning population under the constraints of limited land resources and a warming climate. In this study, we evaluated a 56 entry panel of SRW breeding lines and cultivars from the eastern US wheat region in 2014 for NUE and related traits. The 56-entry block was grown at Lexington and Princeton, KY at two N rates (0 and 112 kg ha−1) in a complete factorial design. We measured normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI), biomass, harvest index, N harvest index, N uptake efficiency, N utilization efficiency, post-anthesis N uptake, N remobilization efficiency and overall NUE. Breeders usually apply high rates of N fertilizer to their plots in order to maximize genetic yield potential. Our study indicates that without screening breeding lines in low N environments concurrently, it will not be possible to identify high NUE genotypes. Post-anthesis N uptake, was highly correlated with yield (r = 0.79) under high N, but heritability of this trait was close to zero. Heritability of NUE, on the other hand was moderately high (h2 = 0.65). Five breeding lines ranked within the top 10 for NUE in both low and high N environments. NDVI was found to be both heritable and highly correlated with yield across N environments (R2 = 0.78). Genome wide association studies of NUE and related traits revealed QTL associated with NUE (chromosome 2B), uptake efficiency (chromosome1B) and utilization efficiency (chromosomes 1A and 3A). In accord with other studies, these QTL are of small effect and will likely only be useful in genomic selection as opposed to marker-assisted selection. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Intercrops of cereals and legumes are grown worldwide, both in smallholder agriculture in developing countries and in organic farming systems in developed countries. The competitive balance between species is a key factor determining productivity in mixtures. Management factors, e.g. sowing time, sowing density and rate of N fertilizer, affect the relative competitiveness and performance of intercropped species. There is a need for an overarching analysis to elucidate general principles governing the relative performance of legumes and cereals in mixtures. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of published studies to explore how the relative yield of legumes and cereals in mixtures responds to relative sowing time, relative density and nitrogen fertilizer. An index for relative sowing time, RST, was developed to quantify the relative difference in sowing time between the intercropped species. RST is defined as the amount of time that a species is sown earlier or later than its companion species, relative to the length of its own growing period. RST is smaller than zero if a species is sown earlier than its companion species and greater than zero if it is sown later. Relative performance of a species was characterized by its relative yield (or partial land equivalent ratio, PLER) in the intercrop compared to the yield in the sole crop. In 409 out of 552 cases, the cereal had a greater relative yield than the legume. Sowing a species earlier than its companion increased its relative yield, and vice versa. An increase in density of a species increased its relative yield and decreased the relative yield of the companion species. The relative yield of cereals increased and that of legumes decreased with the amount of N fertilizer. The negative effect of N on the relative yield of legumes was mitigated if the legume was sown before the cereal. The study shows how the performance of cereals and legumes in an intercrop is affected by sowing densities, relative sowing times, and nitrogen fertilizer. Growers can exploit these relationships to manage competition between cereals and legumes in mixtures and enhance species complementarity, total productivity and economic profit. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Projected global warming and population growth will reduce future water availability for agriculture. Thus, it is essential to increase the efficiency in using water to ensure crop productivity. Quantifying crop water use (WU; i.e. actual evapotranspiration) is a critical step towards this goal. Here, sixteen wheat simulation models were used to quantify sources of model uncertainty and to estimate the relative changes and variability between models for simulated WU, water use efficiency (WUE, WU per unit of grain dry mass produced), transpiration efficiency (Teff, transpiration per kg of unit of grain yield dry mass produced), grain yield, crop transpiration and soil evaporation at increased temperatures and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations ([CO2]). The greatest uncertainty in simulating water use, potential evapotranspiration, crop transpiration and soil evaporation was due to differences in how crop transpiration was modelled and accounted for 50% of the total variability among models. The simulation results for the sensitivity to temperature indicated that crop WU will decline with increasing temperature due to reduced growing seasons. The uncertainties in simulated crop WU, and in particularly due to uncertainties in simulating crop transpiration, were greater under conditions of increased temperatures and with high temperatures in combination with elevated atmospheric [CO2] concentrations. Hence the simulation of crop WU, and in particularly crop transpiration under higher temperature, needs to be improved and evaluated with field measurements before models can be used to simulate climate change impacts on future crop water demand. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Machinery for sowing wheat directly into rice residues has become more common in the rice-wheat systems of the north-west Indo-Gangetic Plains of South Asia, with increasing numbers of farmers now potentially able to access the benefits of residue retention. However, surface residue retention affects soil water and temperature dynamics, thus the optimum sowing date and irrigation management for a mulched crop may vary from those of a traditional non-mulched crop. Furthermore, the effects of sowing date and irrigation management are likely to vary with soil type and seasonal conditions. Therefore, a simulation study was conducted using the APSIM model and 40 years of weather data to evaluate the effects of mulch, sowing date and irrigation management and their interactions on wheat grain yield, irrigation requirement (I) and water productivity with respect to irrigation (WPI) and evapotranspiration (WPET). The results suggest that the optimum wheat sowing date in central Punjab depends on both soil type and the presence or absence of mulch. On the sandy loam, with irrigation scheduled at 50% soil water deficit (SWD), the optimum sowing date was late October to early November for maximising yield, WPI and WPET. On the clay loam, the optimum date was about one week later. The effect of mulch on yield varied with seasonal conditions and sowing date. With irrigation at 50% SWD, mulching of wheat sown at the optimum time increased average yield by up to 0.5 t ha−1. The beneficial effect of mulch on yield increased to averages of 1.2–1.3 t ha−1 as sowing was advanced to 15 October. With irrigation at 50% SWD and 7 November sowing, mulch reduced the number of irrigations by one in almost 50% of years, a reduction of about 50 mm on the sandy loam and 60 mm on the clay loam. The reduction in irrigation amount was mainly due to reduced soil evaporation. Mulch reduced irrigation requirement by more as sowing was delayed, more so on the sandy loam than the clay loam soil. There was little effect of mulch on irrigation requirement for late October sowings. There were large trade-offs between irrigation input, yield, WPET and WPI on the sandy loam with regard to the optimum irrigation schedule. Maximum yield occurred with very frequent irrigation (10–20% SWD) which also had the greatest irrigation input, while WPI was highest with least frequent irrigation (70% SWD), and WPET was highest with irrigation at 40–50% SWD. This was the case with and without mulch. On the clay loam, the trade-offs were not so pronounced, as maximum yield was reached with irrigation at 50% SWD, with and without mulch. However, both WPET and WPI were maximum and irrigation input least at the lowest irrigation frequency (70% SWD). On both soils, maximum yield, WPET and WPI were higher with mulch, while irrigation input was slightly lower, but mulch had very little effect on the irrigation thresholds at which each parameter was maximised. © 2016 The Author(s)

AB  - Research attention to improving source and sink strength in maize production is requisite for enhancing yield. Improvement in source strength has been achieved with higher post-silking dry matter accumulation, whereas historical improvement in sink strength has been mostly attributed to increasing kernel number (KN) per unit area, in part because KN is known to be more vulnerable to abiotic stresses compared to kernel weight (KW). However, KW can also vary widely as it is dependent on both genotype and dry matter accumulation during the post-silking period. In order to illustrate the consequences of breeding efforts over a 4-decade period for enhancing source and sink strength at varying nitrogen rates and plant densities, a 2-year and 2-location study was conducted in 2013 and 2014. Eight commercial hybrids from DeKalb released from 1967 to 2005 were compared at 2 nitrogen rates (55 and 220 kg N ha−1) and 3 plant densities (54,000 (D1), 79,000 (D2) and 104,000 (D3) plants ha−1). Breeding progress increased grain yield per hectare (GY) by an average of 66 kg ha−1 year−1, and grain yield per plant (GYP) by 0.91 g plant−1 year−1 across all treatments and environments. This yield increase with hybrid improvement was attributed more to an increase in KW (1.29 mg kernel−1 year−1 across all treatments and both locations), than to any increase in KN. The overall source-sink ratio (SSR − ratio of post-silking dry matter accumulation to kernel number per plant) also increased by an average of 1.25 mg kernel−1 year−1 across all treatment and locations. The hybrid improvement in SSR was more pronounced at the high N rate or low plant density. Post-silking dry matter accumulation (PostDM) increased by an average of 54 kg ha−1 year−1 across all treatments and locations. KW was highly correlated with ear growth rate (EGR) during grain fill. New hybrids had much higher KW gain per unit of EGR. Newer hybrids also had a longer active grain filling period, but the correlation of post-silking dry matter accumulation to the duration of active grain filling period was weak. This study showed that the breeding progress for yield gain in these DeKalb hybrids was achieved by (i) longer duration of the grain filling period plus longer leaf stay green that accompanied a higher PostDM of newer hybrids, (ii) enhanced source to sink strength during grain filling by a higher SSR in newer hybrids, (iii) improved efficiency for transferring source from cob and husk to grain by increasing KW gain per unit of EGR, and (iv) enhanced stress tolerance in newer hybrids to maintain grain yield even under high density. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - The use of canopy spectral reflectance as a high throughput selection method has been recommended to augment genetic gain from yield based selection in highly variable environments. The objectives of this study were to estimate genotypic correlations between grain yield and spectral reflectance indices (SRIs), and estimate heritability, expected response to selection, relative efficiency of indirect selection, and accuracy of yield predictive models in Pacific Northwest winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under a range of moisture regimes. A diversity panel of 402 winter wheat genotypes (87 hard and 315 soft) was grown in rain-fed and irrigated conditions across the eastern Washington in 2012 and 2013. Canopy spectral reflectance measured at heading, milk, soft dough, and hard dough stages were used to derive several SRIs which generally had higher broad sense heritability (H2) than yield per se. Grain yield and SRIs showed generally high genetic variability and response to selection in moist-cool rain-fed condition. Efficiency of indirect selection for yield using SRIs was high in drought environment and exceeded efficiency of yield-based selection in the soft winter subgroup. Normalized water band index (NWI) showed consistent response to selection across environments, higher genetic correlation with yield (0.51–0.80, p &lt; 0.001), and highest indirect selection efficiency (up to 143%). A yield predictive model with one or more SRIs explained 41–82% of total variation in grain yield (p &lt; 0.001). The repeatability of genotypic performance between years increased when selection was conducted based on both SRIs and grain yield compared to selection based on yield or SRI alone. The generally high heritability of SRIs and their significant genotypic correlation with grain yield highlight the possibility to improve yield and yield stability in winter wheat through remotely sensed phenotyping approaches. © 2016 The Author(s)

AB  - The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) continues to provide easy and fast methodologies to characterize wheat genetic resources in response to abiotic stresses. This study identifies ways to maximize green leaf area duration during grain filling and develops NDVI models to predict physiological maturity and different stay −green parameters to increase grain yield of rainfed winter wheat under terminal drought. Three wheat populations were evaluated: one containing 240 landraces from Afghanistan, the second with 250 modern lines and varieties, tested for two years under low rainfall conditions in Turkey, and the third with 291 landraces from Central and Western Asia (grown for one year in the same location). The onset of senescence, maximum “greenness”, rate of senescence and residual “greenness” at physiological maturity were estimated using sequential measurements of NDVI and have shown significant correlations with grain yield under low rainfall rainfed conditions. Trade-offs were identified among the different stay −green attributes, e.g. delayed onset of senescence and high maximum “greenness” resulted in accelerated rates of senescence and highest yields and were most evident in the landrace populations. It is concluded, that the use of rate of senescence to select for stay −green must be coupled with other stay −green components, e.g. onset of senescence or maximum “greenness” to avoid the effects of the trade-offs on final grain yield. The NDVI decay curves (using the last three NDVI measurements up to maturity) were used to estimate days to maturity using the NDVI decay during the senescence period and days to heading. A training and testing set (20 and 80% of each population, respectively) were used for calibrations allowing for correlations between predicted and observed maturity of up to r = +0.85 (P < 0.0001). This procedure will facilitate large −scale wheat phenotyping in the future. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Developmental patterns strongly influence spike fertility and grain number, which are primarily determined during the stem elongation period (i.e. time between terminal spikelet phase and anthesis). It has been proposed that the length of the stem elongation phase may, to an extent, affect grain number; thus it would be beneficial to identify genetic variation for the duration of this phase in elite germplasm. Variation in these developmental patterns was studied using 27 elite wheat lines in four experiments across three growing seasons. The results showed that the length of the stem elongation phase was (i) only slightly related to the period from seedling emergence to terminal spikelet, and (ii) more relevant than it for determining time to anthesis. Thus, phenological phases were largely independent and any particular time to anthesis may be reached with different combinations of component phases. Yield components were largely explained by fruiting efficiency of the elite lines used: the relationships were strongly positive and strongly negative with grain number and with grain weight, respectively. Although fruiting efficiency showed a positive trend with the duration of stem elongation that was not significant, a boundary function (which was highly significant) suggests that the length of this phase may impose an upper threshold for fruiting efficiency and grain number, and that maximum values of fruiting efficiency may require a relatively long stem elongation phase. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - The US Pacific Northwest (PNW) is characterized by high latitude and Mediterranean climate where wheat production is predominantly rain-fed and often subject to low soil moisture. As a result, selection for drought-adaptive traits in modern cultivars has been an integral component of the regional breeding programs. The goal of this research was to evaluate phenotypic associations of morpho-physiological traits and their response to soil moisture variation in winter wheat germplasm adapted to the PNW. A panel of 402 winter wheat accessions (87 hard and 315 soft) was evaluated for spectral reflectance indices (SRIs), canopy temperature (CT), plant stature, phenology, grain yield, and yield components under rain-fed and irrigated conditions in 2012–2014. Variation in soil moisture and temperature cumulatively explained 86% of total yield variation across years and locations. The phenotypic associations of yield with phenology, plant height, and CT were environment dependent. Various SRIs related to biomass, stay green, pigment composition, and hydration status showed consistent patterns of response to drought and strong correlations with yield (p < 0.001). The compensatory interaction of grain number and weight was indicated in the negative correlation between thousand kernel weight and grain number per spike across moisture regimes. Area under vegetation index curve (AUVIC) explained 53–88% of the total variation in stay green estimated from visual score of flag leaf senescence (p < 0.001). Principal component analysis revealed three major clusters that explained more than 76% of interrelations among traits. The market classes within the study population showed differentiation with respect to these traits. This study highlights the potential use of spectral radiometry in field screening of winter wheat for grain yield and drought adaptation in Mediterranean-like environments. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - In previous investigations, carbon isotope composition (δ13C) has been used in C3 cereals to screen for genotypes with high transpiration efficiency and oxygen isotope composition (δ18O) has been shown to correlate with transpiration rate. We examined associations of δ13C of the grain and flag leaf and δ18O of the flag leaf with respect to grain yield in wheat cultivars in UK field conditions. Field experiments were carried out at University of Nottingham in 2009–10 and 2010–11 testing 17 wheat cultivars under fully irrigated and rain-fed conditions. Averaging across years grain yield was reduced by 1.69 t ha−1 (16.5%) in the rain-fed treatment (P &lt; 0.001). There was a negative linear relationship between grain yield and grain δ13C amongst cultivars, under both irrigated (R2 = 0.47, P &lt; 0.01) and rain-fed (R2 = 0.70, P &lt; 0.001) conditions. Grain δ13C was negatively correlated with flag-leaf stomatal conductance (r = −0.94, P &lt; 0.01) in a subset of six of the cultivars, indicating that higher transpiration efficiency was associated with lower stomatal conductance. The associations between grain yield and flag-leaf δ13C and flag-leaf δ18O amongst cultivars under irrigated and rain-fed conditions were not statistically significant. There was a positive linear relationship between flag-leaf δ18O and grain δ13C amongst cultivars under irrigated conditions (R2 = 0.38, P &lt; 0.01), indicating a trade-off between transpiration and transpiration efficiency (TE). Genetic variation in grain yield under rain-fed conditions was also associated with delayed onset of flag-leaf senescence (R2 = 0.35, P &lt; 0.05). The 17 wheat cultivars ranged in year of release (YoR) from 1964 to 2009 and grain yield increased linearly under irrigated conditions by 60.4 kg ha−1 yr−1 (0.72% yr−1) and under rain-fed conditions by 47.5 kg ha−1 yr−1 (0.66% yr−1) over the 45 year period and grain δ13C composition decreased by 0.0255 and 0.0304‰ yr−1, respectively, indicating genetic gains in wheat yield potential in the UK seem likely to have been achieved through a lower TE, higher water uptake and lesser limitation of stomatal conductance. © 2016

AB  - A model of the lodging process has been successfully adapted for use on spring wheat grown in North-West Mexico (NWM). The lodging model was used to estimate the lodging-associated traits required to enable spring wheat grown in NWM with a typical yield of 6 t ha−1 and plant height of 0.7 m to achieve a lodging return period of 25 years. Target traits included a root plate spread of 51 mm and stem strength of the bottom internode of 268 N mm. These target traits increased to 54.5 mm and 325 N mm, respectively, for a crop yielding 10 t ha−1. Analysis of multiple genotypes across three growing seasons enabled relationships between both stem strength and root plate spread with structural dry matter to be quantified. A NWM lodging resistant ideotype yielding 6 t ha−1 would require 3.93 t ha−1 of structural stem biomass and 1.10 t ha−1 of root biomass in the top 10 cm of soil, which would result in a harvest index (HI) of 0.46 after accounting for chaff and leaf biomass. A crop yielding 10 t ha−1 would achieve a HI of 0.54 for 0.7 m tall plants or 0.41 for more typical 1.0 m tall plants. This study indicates that for plant breeders to achieve both high yields and lodging-proofness they must either breed for greater total biomass or develop high yielding germplasm from shorter crops. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - Declining soil quality is commonplace throughout Southern Asia and sustainable strategies are required to reverse this trend to ensure food security for future generations. One potential solution to halt this decline is the implementation of integrated nutrient management whereby inorganic fertilisers are added together with organic wastes. These organic materials, however, are often quickly broken down in soil and provide only a transitory improvement in soil quality. Biochar, which can potentially persist in soil for centuries, may offer a more permanent solution to this problem. To address this, we undertook a 2-year field trial to investigate the interactions between conventional NPK fertilisers, farmyard manure (FYM) and biochar in a maize cropping system. Biochar application to the nutrient poor soil increased maize yields after year one by approximately 20% although the yield increase was lower in the second year (ca. 12.5%). Overall, there was little difference in grain yield between the 25 t ha−1 and the 50 t ha−1 biochar treatments. In terms of soil quality, biochar addition increased levels of soil organic carbon, inorganic N, P and base cations and had no detrimental impact on pH and salinity in this calcareous soil. Overall, this field trial demonstrated the potential of biochar to induce short-term benefits in crop yield and soil quality in maize cropping systems although the long-term benefits remain to be quantified. From a management perspective, we also highlight potential conflicts in biochar availability and use, which may limit its adoption by small scale farming systems typical of Southern Asia. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Over two growing seasons, we examined the effects of natural field salinity on grain production by a range of wheat and barley genotypes on rainfed (i.e. non-irrigated) land with a Mediterranean climate. Blocks of wheat and barley were grown at adjacent locations, on saline and non-saline sites. The two growing seasons differed in the amount of rain that fell in late Spring during grain filling, which strongly affected soil moisture, and in the salinity of the soil solution during grain filling. On the non-saline site in 2009 (less rain in Spring) there were similar ranges of grain yield between the 27 barley and 90 wheat genotypes; the 5th–95th percentile ranges of grain yield for the two crops were 0.9–2.1 t ha−1 and 0.9–1.9 t ha−1 respectively. However on the saline site in this year, the average salinity of the soil solution during grain filling was ∼0.4 M, and the earlier flowering barley genotypes had higher grain yields (5th–95th percentile 1.5–3.1 t ha−1) than the later flowering wheat genotypes (0.8–2.3 t ha−1). By contrast, in 2011 (dry early Spring, rain in late Spring), on the saline site the average salinity of the soil solution was less than 0.2 M during grain filling, and the 320 wheat and 14 barley genotypes had similar 5th to 95th percentile ranges in grain yield to each other under saline conditions (barley 1.1–3.1 t ha−1; wheat 1.3–2.9 t ha−1). Comparisons of genotypes common to both sites showed that there were wheat (e.g. Mace, Tammarin Rock, Binnu) and barley cultivars (e.g. Mundah, Parent 19) with consistently higher yields under saline conditions. We conclude that grain yield by cereals on saltland is associated with the severity of salinity, the adaptation of genotypes to local conditions, their salt tolerance, and (in seasons with a dry spring) early flowering. © 2016

AB  - The important contribution of rice to global food security requires an understanding of yield gaps in rice-based farming systems. However, estimates of yield gaps are often compromised by a failure to recognize the components that determine them at a local scale. It is essential to define yield gaps by the biological limitations of the genotype and the environment. There exist a number of methods for estimating rice yield gaps, including the use of crop growth simulation models, field experiments and farmer yields. We reviewed the existing literature to (i) assess the methods used to estimate rice yield gaps at a local scale and to summarize the yield gaps estimated in those studies, (ii) identify practical methods of analysis that provides realistic estimates of exploitable rice yield gaps, and (iii) provide recommendations for future studies on rice yield gaps that will allow accurate interpretation of available data at a local level. Rice yield gap analysis can be simplified without sacrificing precision and context specificity. This review identifies the comparison of the attainable farm yield (the mean of the top decile) with the population mean, as a practical and robust approach to estimate an exploitable yield gap that is highly relevant at the local level, taking into account what is achievable given the local socio-economic conditions. With this method we identified exploitable yield gaps ranging from 23 to 42% for one particular season in four different rice growing areas in Southeast Asia. To enable accurate estimation and interpretation of yield gaps in rice production systems, we propose a minimum dataset needed for rice yield gap assessment. Future studies on rice yield gaps should consider the region, season and crop ecosystem (e.g. upland rainfed, lowland irrigated) as a minimum to facilitate decisions at a local level. In addition, we recommend taking into account the cultivar, soil type, planting date, crop establishment method and nitrogen application rates, as well as field topography and toposequence for rainfed systems. A good understanding of rice yield gaps and the factors leading to yield gaps will allow better targeting of agricultural research and development priorities for livelihood improvement and sustainable rice production. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Soil waterlogging impacts 25% of the global area planted to wheat and the development of waterlogging tolerant cultivars lags behind progress that has been made for other abiotic stresses. This study was conducted to identify sources of waterlogging tolerance in soft red winter wheat (SRWW) adapted to the southeastern United States, a region prone to yearly waterlogging. A set of 28 SRWW genotypes were evaluated over two growing seasons in field waterlogging experiments at the Rice Research and Extension Center in Stuttgart, Arkansas. Waterlogging at the late tillering stage resulted in a mean grain yield (GY) reduction of 34%, ranging from 16 to 49% within the tested lines. Total GY was impacted by lower kernel weight spike−1 resulting from reductions in kernels spike−1 and 1000 kernel weight, total biomass and to a lesser extent spike density. An interaction between genotype and the waterlogging treatment (GxT) was observed for days to heading, plant height, kernel weight spike−1, kernels spike−1 and 1000 kernel weight with significant GxT detected for total GY during the first season only. Spectral reflectance measurements of normalized difference vegetative index were highly predictive of both GY (R2 = 0.77) and total biomass (R2 = 0.64) under waterlogging but not in the control, indicating potential for indirect high-throughput screening and selection. Overall, the genotypes 26R22, AR01167-3-1, Magnolia and USG 3555 had significantly higher GY than other genotypes under waterlogging, with USG 3555 also showing a non-significant GY reduction, indicating its potential as a genetic source of waterlogging tolerance. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Future genetic progress in wheat grain yield will depend on increasing above-ground biomass and this must be achieved without commensurate increases in N fertilizer inputs to minimise environmental impacts. Our objective was to quantify variation in grain yield, above-ground biomass and N-use efficiency (NUE) and associated traits in a panel of diverse hexaploid wheat germplasm comprising: (i) landraces from the AE Watkins collection, (ii) synthetic-derived hexaploid lines in a cv. Paragon spring wheat background and (iii) UK modern cultivars including cv. Paragon under low N and high N conditions. A field experiment was carried out in two seasons examining 15 genotypes (five landraces, five synthetic-derived (SD) hexaploid lines and five UK modern cultivars) under low N and high N conditions at Nottingham University farm, UK. Machine-harvested grain yield, above-ground biomass and NUE were measured. Physiological traits were assessed including flag-leaf light-saturated photosynthetic rate (Amax) and relative chlorophyll content (SPAD) under HN conditions; and flag-leaf senescence duration and rate and Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) under LN and HN conditions. Under HN conditions, the modern cultivars overall produced higher grain yield than the SD lines (+9.7%) and the landraces (+60.4%); and the modern cultivars and SD lines also produced higher biomass than the landraces (30.3% and 28.4%, respectively). Under LN conditions, reduction in grain yield and biomass compared to HN conditions was least for the landraces (-1% and -8.6%, respectively), intermediate for the SD lines (-7.4 and -10.2%, respectively) and highest for the modern cultivars (-9.3 and -24.6%, respectively). As a result, the SD lines had higher biomass (+17%) than the modern cultivars under LN conditions. Under HN conditions the synthetic derivatives (23.8 μmol m-2 s-1) and modern cultivars (241.1 μmol m-2 s-1) had higher pre-anthesis Amax than the landraces (19.7 μmol m-2 s-1) (P &lt; 0.001). Pre-anthesis Amax was strongly positively linearly associated with above-ground biomass (R2 = 0.63, P &lt; 0.001) and grain yield (R2 = 0.75, P &lt; 0.001) amongst the 15 genotypes. Flag-leaf Amax was also positively linearly associated with flag-leaf relative chlorophyll content at anthesis (R2 = 0.74; P &lt; 0.001). Comparing the SD lines to the recurrent parent Paragon, under HN conditions one line (SD 22) had higher pre-anthesis flag-leaf Amax than Paragon (P &lt; 0.05). Under LN conditions one line (SD 24, +27%) had higher yield than Paragon (P &lt; 0.05) and two lines (SD 24 and SD 38, +32% and +31%, respectively) had more biomass than Paragon (P &lt; 0.05). Our results indicated that introgressing traits from synthetic-derived wheat and landraces into UK modern wheat germplasm offers scope to raise above-ground biomass and grain yield in moderate-to-low N availability environments. © 2016.

AB  - The demand for rice grain protein content (GPC) differs in different regions of the world. Despite large differences in GPC among cultivars, evaluation of the effects of genotype on GPC is difficult because GPC is influenced not only by cultivar traits (such as nitrogen uptake ability, sink size and heading date) but also by the environment. We hypothesized that grain protein accumulation ability (GPA) also affects GPC. The objective of this study was to clarify the differences in GPA among six lodging-tolerant, high-yielding Japanese cultivars: Bekoaoba, Habataki, Takanari, Hokuriku193, Momiroman, and Akenohoshi. To produce a wide variation in nitrogen availability per unit sink capacity (Nav), we used nitrogen topdressing at heading and spikelet-thinning treatment. In each cultivar, we found a logarithmic relation between GPC and Nav: GPC = A × Ln(Nav) + B, where A is the regression coefficient and B is a constant. A highly significant difference in regression coefficients among cultivars was found (P < 0.01). The regression coefficient was considered to be a measure of GPA; it varied from 0.969 in Bekoaoba to 1.820 in Takanari. This relation suggests that GPC is determined by Nav and GPA and that the environment affects GPC through Nav. GPA is a good criterion for evaluation of the effects of genotype on GPC. Nitrogen harvest index was highly significantly explained by multiple regression with GPA and the ratio of sink capacity to total dry matter production as independent variables, suggesting the influence of GPA on plant nitrogen dynamics during the grain-filling period. Therefore, it would be useful to determine the cultivars' GPA values for optimizing nitrogen management. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Maintaining wheat productivity under the increasing temperatures in South Asia is a challenge. We focused on developing early maturing wheat lines as an adaptive mechanism in regions suffering from terminal heat stress and those areas that require wheat adapted to shorter cycles under continual high temperature stress. We evaluated the grain yield performance of early-maturing heat-tolerant germplasm developed by CIMMYT, Mexico at diverse locations in South Asia from 2009 to 2014 and estimated the breeding progress for high-yielding and early-maturing heat-tolerant germplasm in South Asia. Each year the trial comprised of 28 new entries, one CIMMYT check (Baj) and a local check variety. Locations were classified by mega environment (ME); ME1 being the temperate irrigated locations with terminal high temperature stress, and ME5 as hot, sub-tropical, irrigated locations. Grain yield (GY), days to heading (DTH) and plant height (PH) were recorded at each location. Effect of temperature on GY was observed in both ME1 and ME5. Across years, mean minimum temperatures in ME1 and mean maximum temperatures in ME5 during grain filling had significant negative association with GY. The ME1 locations were cooler that those in ME5 in the 5 years of evaluations and had a 1-2 t/ha higher GY. A mean reduction of 20 days for DTH and 20 cm in PH was observed in ME5. Negative genetic correlations of -0.43 to -0.79 were observed between GY and DTH in South Asia during 2009-2014. Each year, we identified early-maturing germplasm with higher grain yield than the local checks. A positive trend was observed while estimating the breeding progress across five years for high-yielding early-maturing heat tolerant wheat compared to the local checks in South Asia. The results suggests the potential of the high-yielding early-maturing wheat lines developed at CIMMYT in improving wheat production and maintaining genetic gains in South Asia. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Increasing cropping intensity and use of no-till fallow (NTF) has been successful in many rainfed Mediterranean agricultural regions around the world, including of the Inland US Pacific Northwest (PNW) where annual precipitation exceeds 290 mm. However, in the low-precipitation (<290 mm annual) region east-central Washington and north-central Oregon, these practices have not been widely adopted and a 2-year winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-tilled summer fallow rotation is practiced by the vast majority of farmers. The objective here was to evaluate the productivity of seven wheat rotation systems that reduce or eliminate tillage and increase cropping intensity in a 6-year study at Lind, WA. The study included: (i) soft white, hard red, and hard white market classes of wheat; (ii) both NTF and undercutter conservation-tillage summer fallow (UTF), and; (iii) continuous annual no-till cropping of wheat. Crop-year (September 1-August 31) precipitation over the six years averaged just 217 mm. Across years, market class, and rotation system, spring wheat (SW) grain yield was only 33% of winter wheat (WW) after UTF. Thus, although only one crop was produced every other year with WW-UTF, this system had water use efficiency (WUE) of 5.5 grain/mm precipitation versus as low as 3.0 kg grain/mm precipitation for SW with no preceding fallow year. Possible mechanisms for differences in grain yield and WUE among rotations were: (i) Russian thistle (Salsola tragus L.) weed infestation was at least eleven times greater in the various SW systems and much greater still with WW after SW with no fallow year compared to in WW after NTF and UTF, and; (ii) precipitation storage efficiency (PSE) in the 180 cm soil profile during fallow for NTF-WW-SW was only 30% compared to 39 and 42% for the UTF-WW-SW and UTF-WW treatments, respectively. Critically, the seed zone of NTF was too dry for early planting of WW in most years whereas adequate seed-zone water was present every year in the UTF systems. Primarily due to late planting necessitated from lack of seed-zone water, grain yield of WW after NTF was reduced 35% compared to WW after UTF. Optimum grain yields and soil conservation are both required for sustainable agriculture, and WW with the UTF method was the clear winner of systems evaluated in this study. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Reduced height 8 (Rht8) is the main alternative to the GA-insensitive Rht alleles in hot and dry environments where it reduces plant height without yield penalty. The potential of Rht8 in northern-European wheat breeding remains unclear, since the close linkage with the photoperiod-insensitive allele Ppd-D1a is unfavourable in the relatively cool summers. In the present study, two near-isogenic lines (NILs) contrasting for the Rht8/tall allele from Mara in a UK-adapted and photoperiod-sensitive wheat variety were evaluated in trials with varying nitrogen fertiliser (N) treatments and water regimes across sites in the UK and Spain.The Rht8 introgression was associated with a robust height reduction of 11% regardless of N treatment and water regime and the Rht8 NIL was more resistant to root-lodging at agronomically-relevant N levels than the tall NIL. In the UK with reduced solar radiation over the growing season than the site in Spain, the Rht8 NIL showed a 10% yield penalty at standard agronomic N levels due to concomitant reduction in grain number and spike number whereas grain weight and harvest index were not significantly different to the tall NIL. The yield penalty associated with the Rht8 introgression was overcome at low N and in irrigated conditions in the UK, and in the high-temperature site in Spain. Decreased spike length and constant spikelet number in the Rht8 NIL resulted in spike compaction of 15%, independent of N and water regime. The genetic interval of Rht8 overlaps with the compactum gene on 2DS, raising the possibility of the same causative gene. Further genetic dissection of these loci is required. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - There is an increasing awareness about the need for improving nitrogen use efficiency in crop production in order to meet economic and ecological standards. The present work provides insight into the varietal factors of wheat that determine nitrogen use in the plant. The performance of eleven winter wheat varieties in terms of grain yield and nitrogen uptake and use efficiency was tested within the framework of a 40-year long term field experiment of organic enrichment and mineral nitrogen fertilisation treatments. Globally, organic enrichment had a beneficial effect on the yield and grain nitrogen concentration and showed a strong interaction with the amount of applied mineral nitrogen fertiliser. Manure application generally had positive effects on varietal performances mainly due to indirect long term effects on the soil properties. Varieties showed a broad range of responses to the treatments of the long term experiment, revealing significant genotype × environment interactions. Nevertheless, the varieties which performed well at high input levels were also the best at low input levels, suggesting that the genotype × environment interactions were not strong enough to inverse the performance ranking. Similarly, the varietal traits associated with high yielding or grain nitrogen concentration in high input conditions were the same as those identified under low input conditions. To conclude, these results suggest that the selection of wheat for nitrogen efficiency is possible under any nitrogen fertilisation regime. However, to be adapted to low input or organic agriculture, varieties also need traits other than nutrient use efficiency, for example, disease resistance, resilience to abiotic stresses and competitiveness against weeds. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rice-rice rotation is the most important intensive cropping system for food security in China. So far, few studies have examined sustainability of double-rice cropping system using partial substitution of fertilizer N (FN) by green manure (GM). The effects of 100% FN (N100) and different substitution rates of FN by GM (80%, 60%, 40% and 20% FN plus 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% N through GM, and represented respectively by N80M20, N60M40, N40M60 and N20M80) on the rice productivity and N-supplying capacity of paddy soil were evaluated in double-rice system from 2008 to 2013. Soil organic matter and total N content in the 0-15 cm layer and rice grain yield of early and late rice annually increased in N80M20 and N60M40 plots, but decreased in N100, N40M60 and N20M80 plots. Compared with N100 plots, the NH4+-N content and agronomic efficiency of applied N significantly increased in N80M20 and N60M40 plots. The grain yield and sustainable yield index of rice crops were improved in N80M20 and N60M40 plots, while declined in N40M60 and N20M80. Soil NO3--N content decreased significantly under partial substitutions of GM for FN. It can be concluded that the appropriate substitution of GM for FN (e.g., 20-40%) is beneficial for improving the productivity and sustainability of paddy field under double-rice cropping system. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A field trial to investigate the effects of plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) Paenibacillus yonginensis (DCY84T) and/or SiO2 seed coating on rice growth (Oryza sativa L.) was carried out on reclaimed tidal land in Taean County in South Korea. The field test was performed twice between May-October 2014 and May-October 2015, in a randomized complete block (RCB) design with three replications. Treatments consisted of: Mock, DCY84T-treated seeds, SiO2-coated seeds and DCY84T-SiO2-treated seeds and each treatment area covered approximately 300 m2. During the early developmental period of rice seedlings, the SiO2 coating without DCY84T led to the most favorable 30 DAS rice seedling parameters. Moreover, the combination of DCY84T and SiO2 treatments resulted in 2-fold greater fresh and dry weights of 60 DAS rice seedlings compared to Mock seedlings. DCY84T and SiO2, both individually and together, produced a greater grain yield and a greater total yield; specifically, DCY84T and SiO2 treatments yielded a 73% and 70% increase in mass compared to Mock plants, respectively. Rice treated with both DCY84T and SiO2 treatment contained the highest amount of Al, Fe, Ca and Mg, which were 54%, 169%, 42% and 67% higher than the Mock rice, respectively. Remarkably, DCY84T treatment had the most phosphate [P], potassium [K] and total nitrogen [T-N]. DCY84T and/or SiO2 treatment highly increased the whole kernel percentage. Thus, lower its broken kernel percentage to 9.60-24.58%. The protein content of the grain with both treatments was 7.2%, which was greater than that of the Mock grain (6.0%). The content of chlorophyll a, b and carotinoid in the rice leaves which were treated with silica and DCY84 has increased more than the mock without treatment. After harvest, the GABA content of brown rice was increased to 1.9-fold (2014), 1.5 fold (2015) compared to mock grain, respectively. Overall, DCY84T treatment and SiO2 coating can be useful methods for promoting growth of rice under conditions of saline stress. Results from other laboratory trials and greenhouse experiments are also provided. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Soil biochar amendments are hypothesized to help mitigate potential negative soil quality effects of harvesting crop residues for bioenergy production. This study quantified effects of a onetime biochar application on crop yields and changes in soil properties at a Midwestern U.S.A. site where corn (Zea mays) stover is being harvested. The long-term experiment was established in Boone County, Iowa by application of 0, 9.8, and 18.4 Mg ha-1 of &lt;0.64 cm hardwood biochar, in the fall of 2007. Soil properties were measured in summer 2010, three years after the biochar application and following two stover harvests (0, ~50 and ~90% of above ground residue). Fertilization rates were adjusted to account for removal of nutrients with residue. Corn and biomass yields were measured for the 2008-2012 crop years. Biochar applications increased total carbon (TC) of soils by about 0.5% and soil pH by about 0.5 pH units but had no significant effect on total nitrogen (TN), soil test nutrient concentrations, bulk density (BD), aggregate stability or effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC). Residue removal had no significant effect on TC, TN, ECEC, or soil test nutrients except for Mehlich III extractable Zn and S concentrations. The 90% residue removal treatment significantly reduced wet aggregate mean weight diameter by 13% compared to no residue harvest. During the first five years of the study, the 50 and 90% residue removal treatments significantly increased corn grain yields by 1.4 Mg ha-1, averaged across all biochar treatments. When analyzed on an annual basis, biochar had no significant effect on grain yield, but when averaged across years, the 18.4 Mg ha-1 biochar application rate significantly increased yields by 0.49 Mg ha-1 for the zero residue removal treatment but not for the 50% and 90% residue removal treatments. Residue removal increased yield to a greater extent during years of stress due to either excess moisture (2008 and 2010) or drought (2012). There was no yield effect in 2011, a year with favorable climatic conditions. The results suggest that during the first five years of study, residue removal in general had positive effect on yield of continues corn. Application of biochar at the high rate increased yield in the plots with 0% residue removal. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The physiological process of how anthesis time and leaf senescence patterns affect individual grain weight of wheat has only been partially elucidated. In this study, a recombinant inbred line mapping population of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L. 'Forno') and its relative spelt (Triticum spelta L. 'Oberkulmer'), contrasting for phasic development and leaf senescence kinetics, was used to understand the physiological and genetic relationships among anthesis time, leaf senescence, grain filling processes, and individual grain weight. Phenotypic measurements were taken in the field over two growing seasons. The results showed that earlier anthesis and delayed leaf senescence were associated with larger grains. Furthermore, early anthesis and delayed but fast leaf senescence promoted grain filling rate (but shortened its duration), grain water absorption rate and maximum grain water content, while individual grain dry matter and water accumulation displayed strong relationships with individual grain weight. A total of 118 significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified in this mapping population, including six QTL for anthesis dates, 24 for flag leaf senescence, 69 for grain filling traits, and 19 for individual grain weight. Frequent QTL coincidences between these traits were observed on chromosomes 2A, 3B, 4A, 4DL, 5A, 5B, 5DL and 7B. Analysis of allelic effects confirmed the above physiological relationships. Therefore, anthesis time and leaf senescence affect individual grain weight at least partly through their effects on individual grain dry matter and water accumulation, resulting from pleiotropy or tight gene linkages. Slightly early anthesis, and delayed but fast leaf senescence, can be used to maximize individual grain weight and yield potential in wheat. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this review, comparisons between organic and conventional cropping systems are discussed. Publications from four topics, crop yields, carbon sequestration, biological diversity and nitrogen leaching were selected as examples to point out pitfalls and shortcomings in comparative analysis that can weaken or even disqualify evaluations. Inconsistent results between different comparative studies were found to be pseudo-contradictions. As the experimental design of comparative organic and conventional cropping systems often is biased in some aspects, suitable denominators for comparative assessment are discussed (ratios per area, per product and per land demand for the same amount of product). Conditions for equitable evaluations are outlined in order to avoid biased design, inappropriate interpretations and flawed conclusions. We stress that respecting at least three stringency criteria will help to ensure the scientific quality of data interpretation of comparative studies: similar soil fertility status at start, comparable type of crop production, and quantification of off-farm organic and nutrient input. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Insufficient and unbalanced fertiliser use widens cassava yield gaps. We assessed the spatial variability of optimal fertiliser requirements of cassava for enhanced nutrient use efficiency and increased yield using the balanced nutrition approach of the QUEFTS model. Two datasets comprised of five fertiliser experiments conducted at eight locations across Southern Togo, Southern Ghana and Northern Ghana from 2007 to 2012 were used. The ratio of storage roots dry matter yield over the sum of available N, P and K expressed in crop nutrient equivalent from the soil and nutrient inputs was used as a proxy to estimate nutrient use efficiency. Nutrient use efficiencies of 20.5 and 31.7 kg storage roots dry matter per kilo crop nutrient equivalent were achieved at balanced nutrition at harvest index (HI) values of 0.50 and 0.65, respectively. N, P and K supplies of 16.2, 2.7 and 11.5 kg at an HI of 0.50, and 10.5, 1.9 and 8.4 kg at an HI of 0.65 were required to produce 1000 kg of storage roots dry matter. The corresponding optimal NPK supply ratios are 6.0-1.0-4.2 and 5.3-1.0-4.2. Nutrient use efficiencies decreased above yields of 77-93% of the maximum. Evaluation of the performance of blanket fertiliser rates recommended by national research services for cassava production resulted in average benefit:cost ratios of 2.4 ± 0.9, which will be unattractive to many farmers compared to 3.8 ± 1.1 for the balanced fertiliser rates. The indigenous soil supply of nutrients revealed that, at balanced nutrition, K was the most limiting nutrient to achieve storage roots yields up to 8 Mg dry matter ha-1 at most sites, whereas N and P were needed at greater yields. Dry weight of storage roots measured on the control plots in our researcher managed experiment ranged from 5.6 to 12.2 Mg ha-1, and were larger than the average weight in farmers' fields in West Africa of 4 Mg ha-1. Substantial yield increase could be attained in the region with improved crop management and fertiliser requirements formulation on the basis of balanced nutrition. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Favorable climate and soils for rainfed crop production, together with a relatively low population density, results in 70-90% of Argentina grain production being exported. No assessment to date has tried to estimate the potential for extra grain production for soybean, wheat and maize, which account for 78% of total harvested area, by yield gap closure on existing cropland area and its impact at a global scale. The objectives of this paper are (i) to estimate how much additional grain could be produced without expanding crop area by closing yield gaps in Argentina, (ii) to investigate how this production and yield gaps varies across regions and years, and (iii) to analyze how these inter-annual variations are related to El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon (ENSO). Production increase on existing crop area was assessed for soybean, wheat and maize by quantifying the yield gap (Yg), that is, the difference between water-limited yield potential (Yw) and actual yield (Ya). A bottom-up approach was followed to estimate Yw and Yg, in which these parameters were first estimated for specific locations in major crop producing areas and subsequently up-scaled to country level based on spatial distribution of crop area and climate zones. Locally-calibrated crop simulation models were used to estimate Yw at each selected location based on long-term weather data and dominant soil types and management practices. For the analyzed period, the national level Yg represented 41% of Yw for both wheat and maize and 32% of the Yw for soybean. If farmers had closed Yg from these levels to 20% of Yw, Argentina could have increased soybean, wheat and maize production by a respective 7.4, 5.2, and 9.2. Mt, without expanding cropland area. This additional production would have represented an increase of 9%, 4%, and 9% of soybean, wheat, and maize global exports. This potential grain surplus was, however, highly variable because of the ENSO phenomenon: attainable soybean production was 12. Mt higher in favorable "El Niño" years compared with unfavorable "La Niña" years. Interestingly, Yg tended to be higher in wet years, suggesting that farmers do not take full advantage of years with favorable conditions for rainfed crop production. Regional variation in Yg was found in Argentina highlighting the usefulness of this work as a framework to target research and, ultimately, reduce gaps in areas where current yields are well below their potential. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Foliar fungicides in wheat are typically used to safeguard against economic losses from diseases. In this study, we assessed the effects of three fungicide spray regimes [single, double, and triple treatments] on four different grain quality parameters [thousand grain weight (TGW), test weight (TW), grain protein content (GPC), and Zeleny sedimentation volume (ZSV)] during the 2006-2009 period at two sites in Luxembourg. The fungicides used were generally a mix of chlorothalonil and triazoles. At Burmerange, (cultivar Cubus), the values of TGW, TW, GPC and ZSV ranged from 38 to 62g, 67 to 83kghl-1, 12.0% to 14.7% dry matter (DM), and 27 to 54ml, respectively. Whereas, at Everlange (cultivar Achat), the ranges of TGW, TW, GPC and ZSV were 42 to 65g, 65 to 81kghl-1, 11.0% to 15.0% DM, and 21 to 66ml, respectively. In more than 75% cases, the results indicate that fungicides did not significantly affect TW or ZSV at either sites (P&gt;0.05). However, there was a significant and positive fungicide effect on GPC in 2006 and 2009 at Burmerange, and only in 2006 at Everlange (P&lt;0.05). On the contrary, TGW was significantly affected at Burmerange in all years, except 2008 when a positive increase was observed compared to control plots; and in 2006 and 2007 at Everlange. Interestingly, when there was an effect of fungicides on a quality parameter, there was no difference among different fungicide treatments. Thus under conditions prevailing in Luxembourg, a single fungicide treatment applied with judicious timing generally resulted in statistically similar grain quality parameters when compared with a double or triple fungicide treatment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Conservation agriculture (CA) has been promoted as a method of sustainable intensification and climate change mitigation and is being widely practiced and implemented globally. However, no-till (NT), a fundamental component of CA, has been shown to reduce yields in many cases. In order to maintain yields following adoption of CA, it has been recently suggested that fertilizer application should be an integral component of CA. To determine the contribution of nitrogen (N) fertilizer in minimizing yield declines following NT implementation, we assessed 2759 paired comparisons of NT and conventional tillage (CT) systems from 325 studies reported in the peer-reviewed literature between 1980 and 2013. Overall, we found that NT yields decreased -10.7% (-14.8% to -6.5%) and -3.7% (-5.3% to -2.2%) relative to CT in tropical/subtropical and temperate regions, respectively. Among management and environmental variables that included: the rate of N fertilization; the duration of the NT/CT comparison; residue, rotation, and irrigation practices; the crop type; and the site aridity, N rate was the most important explanatory variable for NT yield declines in tropical/subtropical regions. In temperate regions, N fertilization rates were relatively less important. NT yield declines were most consistently observed at low rates of N fertilization during the first 2 years of NT adoption in tropical/subtropical regions. Applications of N fertilizer at rates of up to 85±12kgNha-1yr-1 significantly reduced NT yield declines in these scenarios. While this result should not be viewed as a rate recommendation, it does suggest that farmers applying rates of N fertilizer that are low for their specific system will, on average, see higher NT yields if they increase application rates. In addition, when crop rotation was not practiced or residues were removed from the field, NT yield declines were magnified by low rates of N fertilization in tropical/subtropical regions. These results, based on a global data set and across a broad range of crops, highlight the importance of N fertilization in counteracting yield declines in NT systems, particularly in tropical/subtropical regions. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - No-till agriculture represents a relatively widely adopted management system that aims to reduce soil erosion, decrease input costs, and sustain long-term crop productivity. However, its impacts on crop yields are variable, and an improved understanding of the factors limiting productivity is needed to support evidence-based management decisions. We conducted a global meta-analysis to evaluate the influence of various crop and environmental variables on no-till relative to conventional tillage yields using data obtained from peer-reviewed publications (678 studies with 6005 paired observations, representing 50 crops and 63 countries). Side-by-side yield comparisons were restricted to studies comparing conventional tillage to no-till practices in the absence of other cropping system modifications. Crop category was the most important factor influencing the overall yield response to no-till followed by aridity index, residue management, no-till duration, and N rate. No-till yields matched conventional tillage yields for oilseed, cotton, and legume crop categories. Among cereals, the negative impacts of no-till were smallest for wheat (-2.6%) and largest for rice (-7.5%) and maize (-7.6%). No-till performed best under rainfed conditions in dry climates, with yields often being equal to or higher than conventional tillage practices. Yields in the first 1-2 years following no-till implementation declined for all crops except oilseeds and cotton, but matched conventional tillage yields after 3-10 years except for maize and wheat in humid climates. Overall, no-till yields were reduced by 12% without N fertilizer addition and 4% with inorganic N addition. Our study highlights factors contributing to and/or decreasing no-till yield gaps and suggests that improved targeting and adaptation, possibly including additional system modifications, are necessary to optimize no-till performance and contribute to food production goals. In addition, our results provide a basis for conducting trade-off analyses to support the development of no-till crop management and international development strategies based on available scientific evidence. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Legume hairy vetch and non-legume barley mixtures are broadly cultivated to improve the value of cover crops in mono-rice paddies. Nevertheless, the effects of mixing conditions of the two cover crops on biomass and nutrient productivities and on the yield characteristics of subsequent rice crops have not been well studied. To evaluate the effects of mix-seeding legume and non-legume cover crops on the value of green manure in paddy soil, barley and hairy vetch were sown at the rice harvesting stage as pure crops at the recommended rates (180kgha-1 of barley, B100; 90kgha-1 of hairy vetch, V100), and as mixtures, in which the two cover crops were mix-seeded with varying seed ratios according to the replacement principle. The mixed seeding of the two crops significantly increased the cover crop biomass and nutrient productivities compared with the single barley and hairy vetch cultivation. Biomass productivity linearly increased with increasing barley seeding level, but it was not affected by the hairy vetch seeding rate. The total N content of the barley biomass clearly increased as the proportion of the total biomass accounted for by hairy vetch was increased, and this significantly improved the value of the green manure of cover crop biomass. In contrast, the total N content of the hairy vetch biomass was not affected by changes in the barley proportion. Biomass produced in the pure barley seeding could not produce the nutrients required by the recommended chemical fertilization level (N-P2O5-K2O=90-45-57kgha-1) for rice, but the biomass increase caused by mixed seeding of the two cover crops resulted in enough nutrients to satisfy the recommended fertilization level. The highest biomass and nutrient yields were observed for the mixed seeding of barley and hairy vetch at 25 and 75% (B75V25) of their respective recommended seeding rates. This increased nutrient input stimulated the rice plant growth and significantly improved the rice yields. The highest yields were achieved with the B75V25 treatment. In conclusion, mixed seeding of legume hairy vetch and non-legume barley could be a very useful agronomic practice for increasing the cover crop biomass and its nutrient productivity and to improve the productivity of subsequent rice crops in temperate rice paddies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Food insecurity and malnutrition are two major challenges facing rural populations in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA.). Hybrids of quality protein maize (QPM) have a crucial role here to play because QPM contains increased lysine and tryptophan concentrations and has a higher biological value than the normal maize. Information on the combining ability and heterotic patterns of QPM inbreds is crucial for the success of hybrid programs in the sub-region. Ninety-one diallel crosses derived from 14 early maturing yellow-endosperm QPM inbreds were evaluated from 2010 to 2012 under Striga infested, drought, low-N and optimal environments in Nigeria. The objectives were to (i) examine the combining ability of the set of early yellow QPM inbreds, (ii) classify the inbreds into heterotic groups and identify the best testers (iii) compare the efficiencies of the heterotic grouping methods in classifying the inbreds and (iv) determine the grain yield and stability of the inbreds in hybrid combinations under the research environments. General (GCA) and specific (SCA) combining ability effects were important in the inheritance of grain yield and other traits of the inbreds. However, GCA was more important than SCA under each contrasting environment and across environments suggesting that the additive gene action was more important than the non-additive in the set of inbreds. The SCA effects of grain yield and the heterotic group's SCA and GCA of grain yield (HSGCA) methods classified the inbreds into three groups each, while the heterotic grouping based on GCA of multiple traits (HGCAMT) and the SNP-based genetic distance (GD) methods had two groups each across research environments. There was close correspondence among the classifications of all the grouping methods in terms of placement of inbreds into the same heterotic groups. The SNP-based method was the most efficient and was used to identify TZEQI 87 and TZEQI 91 as the best testers for the SNP-based heterotic groups 1 and 2. The hybrids, TZEQI 87 × TZEQI 93, TZEQI 77 × TZEQI 91 and TZEQI 80 × TZEQI 91 were identified as the most stable and high yielding across research environments and should be commercialized. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Since the ground breaking work of Norman Borlaug in the 1960s produced large increases in yields of our major cereal crops, we have seen a gradual decline in annual yield progress. The genetic potential of the yield components harvest index and grain number, which were targeted in the "green revolution" and subsequently by cereal breeders have largely been optimised in our two largest global cereal crops, rice and wheat. Physiologists and breeders are turning to the biomass portion of the yield equation and in particular radiation use efficiency, as a means to push the yield potential barrier. Consequently, in the last decade a large effort has been initiated to identify targets to improve photosynthetic performance both using non-transgenic Phenomics approaches and transgenic technologies. Efficiency of light interception, harvesting and energy utilisation have been targeted but most efforts have so far focussed on improving photosynthetic capacity and efficiency in photosynthetic carbon metabolism in rice, wheat and model plants. Here the targets for improving light harvesting and carbon fixation are reviewed, the progress thus far evaluated and the likelihood of success of these activities in improving crop yields discussed in the context of modelling and scaling from the leaf to the canopy. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Localized phosphorus (P) plus nitrogen (N) fertilization results in an ammonium-dependent enhancement of maize (Zea mays L.) growth and nutrient uptake at the seedling stage. However, how N forms affect maize growth, grain yield components, and agronomic N-use efficiency (AEN) in field conditions is not fully understood. A 2-year field experiment with maize growing on a calcareous soil was conducted with localized application of NH4+-N, P (superphosphate), P plus either NO3--N, NH4+-N or NH4:NO3 (1:1) at sowing and jointing as well as no N and P as control (CK). The results showed that localized supply of NH4+-N+P as starter fertilizer and as side-dressing at jointing increased shoot dry weight and N and P accumulation at different stages when compared with CK, localized application of P or NO3--N+P in 2012 and 2013, even when NH4+-N was applied with nitrate (1:1, meaning NH4+-N was reduced by 50%) or NH4+-N was supplied without P. Plant growth rate (PGR) and dry matter distribution in ear at grain filling (25 days after the onset of anthesis) were higher in localized NH4+-N, NH4:NO3 (1:1)+P and NH4+-N+P than CK, localized P and NO3--N+P treatments. The grain yield and N concentration in grain increased by 10-48% and 4-27%, respectively, in localized NH4+-N, NH4:NO3 (1:1)+P and NH4+-N+P treatments compared with CK, localized P and NO3--N+P in two years. The AEN and kernel number per ear were enhanced by supply of NH4+-N, NH4:NO3 (1:1)+P or NH4+-N+P, but not with NO3--N+P. There was a positive linear correlation between kernel number per ear and PGR. The NH4+-N supply in localized NH4+-N+P treatment accounted for more than 50% of variation in PGR, shoot dry matter and grain yield at maturity in 2012 and 2013. The results indicate that localized application of P with NH4+-N enhances maize grain yield, kernel number per ear and agronomic N-use efficiency on calcareous soil via improving post-anthesis growth, dry matter distribution and nutrient accumulation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Irish potato is the third most important carbohydrate food crop in Zimbabwe after maize and wheat. In 2012, the Government of Zimbabwe declared it a strategic national food security crop. In this study, we examine the country's potential for increasing Irish potato yield and help ease the nation's food security challenges. The magnitude of food production increase on already existing croplands depends on the difference between the current actual yields and the potential yield of the crop in the given agro-ecological environment, also called the yield gap. We used three already well-understood types of yield gap: (1) the gap between actual farmer yields, Ya, and the maximum (potential) yield, Yp, achieved when a crop is grown under conditions of non-limiting water and nutrient supply with biotic stress effectively controlled; (2) the gap between Ya and the water-limited yield, Yw, which is the maximum yield attainable under rainfed systems; and (3) the gap between Ya, and the highest yield, Yh, achieved by the best farmers in an agro-ecological area. A grower survey was conducted on the different potato production systems in the country in order to establish the actual yields and input application rates used in potato production. The actual potato yields were used to calculate efficiencies of natural and synthetic resources use. Potential and water-limited yields, and planting times of potato were established for the different agro-ecological regions using the LINTUL-POTATO model, a model based on interception and utilisation of incoming solar radiation. The mean actual yield observed ranged from 8 to 35% of the potential yield, translating to a yield gap of 65 to 92%, hence there is a huge potential to increase production. Simulated potential water use efficiency based on evapotranspiration range was 19-27gpotato/l against the actual water use efficiency of 2-6gpotato/l based on irrigation and rainfall. The current high fertiliser application rates and low actual yields we report, suggest inefficient fertiliser use in potato production in Zimbabwe. The average actual fungicide and insecticide use efficiencies were 0.7 and 13kgpotato/g active ingredient, respectively, across all production systems. All sampled growers lacked knowledge on integrated pest management, a concept which could possibly improve the biocide use efficiency through lowering biocide application rates while maintaining or even improving yields. Our analysis suggests that there is opportunity to improve water, nutrients and biocides resource use efficiencies and increase potato actual yields in Zimbabwe. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Winter oilseed rape production is typically characterised by low nitrogen (N) use efficiency. Defining site-specific fertiliser strategies based on field trials and crop modelling may help to improve the ecological efficiency of this crop. However, no model has been evaluated for winter oilseed rape that simulates the growth of the plant as limited by the interaction of water and N. In this study, the APSIM canola model which was originally developed for the temperate regions of Australia, was adapted for conditions in Germany and tested against measured data (total biomass, grain yield, leaf area index, N-uptake and soil mineral N) at three sites near Göttingen (northern Germany). In the second part of the study, the evaluated model was used in a simulation experiment to explore site-specific climate and soil related production limitations to match fertiliser rates to yield targets. Historical weather data from four sites across northern Germany and a fertile loamy soil with different rooting depths, implicating different plant available water capacities, were used. Model results showed large differences in yield (up to 1000 kg ha-1) and N-balance (>30 kg ha-1) for 200kg N-fertiliser rate ha-1 between restricted (50cm) and unrestricted rooting depths. Simulated yields for such high N-fertiliser rate were lower for sites with continental climate than for sites close to the coast, reflecting different rainfall patterns. Results indicate that water supply plays a critical role when maintaining high N use efficiency and reaching simultaneously grain yields of 4000 kg ha-1. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Improving the climate resilience of crops is particularly important in the semi-arid tropics (SAT) where variability and uncertainty of precipitation is expected to increase under climate change with detrimental impacts on the vulnerability of livelihoods of small farm holders. This study analyses a long-term strategic experiment datasets from fifteen experiments (1981-1995) managed under different fertility levels at International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru and on-farm balanced nutrition management trials (2010-2012) in Karnataka, India to evaluate the pearl millet performance in contrasting seasons with improved agronomic management. Long-term climate variability and yield trends were analyzed using ICRISAT's weather datasets. On-farm data analysis revealed that majority of farmers' field soils were deficient in organic carbon, available phosphorous, sulphur, zinc and boron at all the locations studied. Pearl millet grain yield and above ground dry matter was improved significantly with balanced nutrient application (NPK. +. S. +. Zn. +. B) in farmers' field which were critically deficient in the soil nutrients. Even in comparatively drier years, application of balanced nutrient significantly increased grain yield and aboveground dry matter which provides resilience against drought through enhanced water productivity. Long-term experiments conducted in ICRISAT showed that nitrogen application increased grain yield and above ground dry matter in pearl millet however seasonal variability had a greater effect on yield than cultivars and applied N. Pearl millet yield was positively associated with August maximum temperature and negatively with seasonal precipitation. September precipitation >125. mm which coincided with grain filling stage reduced grain yield. Benefit:cost analysis showed that balanced nutrient application of pearl millet is an economically sustainable option across the seasons. Pearl millet can be an important component of climate resilient agriculture in low production environments when managed with improved agronomic practices. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Grain legume production offers multiple environmental benefits and can enhance sustainability of European farming, but their production area is declining constantly. Grain legume competitiveness is frequently constrained by lower gross margins compared to agronomically suitable cropping alternatives, but it can be improved by appreciating their ability to increase yield of subsequent crop(s) and, potentially, to reduce input requirements (fertiliser, biocide, tillage). Information on the magnitude of grain legume pre-crop effects is diverse and has not been synthesised for European agriculture. This paper reviews research on pre-crop benefits to yield and input requirements of subsequent crops, and the farm-economic profitability of grain legumes in European cropping systems. This includes an analysis of the magnitude of pre-crop benefits to cereal yields measured in 29 experiments in Europe; and 19 studies on grain legume gross margins ranging from crop to cropping system level are assessed. In the available studies, yield benefits of legumes to subsequent crops are highest under low nitrogen fertilisation to subsequent crops and fertilisation can be reduced by 60kgNha-1 on average under maintenance of acceptable yields. With the aim at maximising yield potential, nitrogen fertilisation following grain legumes can be reduced by 23-31kgha-1, and cereal yields are mostly 0.5-1.6Mgha-1 higher than after cereal pre-crops. With adequate estimates of pre-crop benefits, gross margins of full crop rotations can better assess grain legume competitiveness. In the studies reviewed, 35 of 53 modelled crop rotations with grain legumes were competitive with comparable non-legume rotations. Grain legume rotations were more competitive under conservation tillage systems if gross margin calculations accounted for cost savings arising from adjusted machinery requirements. In conclusion, grain legume pre-crop value is a crucial component of their farm-economic profitability in European cropping systems, but further experimental research is required to ascertain its magnitude. Expanding profitability measures to consider pre-crop effects substantially increases the number of situations where grain legumes can compete with cereals, and has a small positive effect on their competitiveness with alternative break crops. Besides a better consideration of the pre-crop value, further genetic and agronomic improvement in legume cropping, supportive market development, and policy support are required if Europe is to utilise environmental benefits of legumes and increase the sustainability of its farming. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - The productivity of rice in most tropical coastal areas of Asia is low because of the predominance of several abiotic and biotic stresses, use of long duration traditional landraces or old varieties and suboptimal management practices. A combination of high-yielding, stress-tolerant rice varieties and good management practices is necessary to enhance the productivity of these areas. Suboptimal nursery management using traditional methods practiced in these areas often leads to a reduced plant population because of seedling mortality leading to poor yields. Nursery management practices that suit the new stress-tolerant varieties recently becoming available need to be developed to increase the productivity of rice. On-station and on-farm trials on nursery management were conducted using improved rice varieties to study the effect of seed density, nutrient management in the nursery, and seedling age at transplanting on grain yield. Lower seed density and application of balanced nutrients produced healthy and taller seedlings with high seedling vigor index (SVI) in the nursery and with subsequent significant increase in grain yield after transplanting in the main field. Combining inorganic and organic fertilizers in the seedbed (50-30-15kg N-P2O5-K2Oha-1+5tha-1 farm yard manures; FYM) enhanced seedling growth (dry weight, shoot and root length, number of green leaves, leaf area) and leaf nitrogen concentration. Forty-d-old seedlings produced significantly higher yield than 25-d-old seedlings. Transplanting older seedlings is important in systems without good water control, un-leveled fields, and soils affected by salt stress; and taller seedlings help avoid losses caused by floods. The highest benefit/cost ratios of 1.82, 1.72 and 1.91 were observed when transplanting 40-d-old seedlings using a seed density of 25gm-2 and with balanced nutrient application of 50-30-15kg N-P2O5-K2O+5t FYMha-1, respectively. In the on-farm trials, the yield advantages when using new stress-tolerant rice varieties Swarna-Sub1 and Amal-Mana with improved nursery management practices were 23% and 47%, in comparison with farmers' nursery management and farmers' variety, respectively. These cost-effective nursery management approaches have great potential for enhancing yield in stress-prone rainfed coastal areas and will help sustain rice yield while ensuring sustainability of the cropping system. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The irrigated rice-wheat system of north west India is not sustainable, as currently practised, due to over-exploitation of groundwater, soil degradation, labour scarcity, high fuel and labour costs, and air pollution from stubble burning. Labour and water scarcity are driving farmers to change from puddling and manual transplanting of rice to mechanised dry seeding. The introduction of dry seeding to the rice-wheat system brings with it the potential to adopt conservation agriculture (CA), with reduced or zero tillage for all crops, and surface residue retention. This would further reduce fuel and labour costs for crop establishment, and air pollution, and also bring benefits for soil structure and nutrient cycling. However, whether conversion to CA rice-wheat systems would help solve the problem of groundwater depletion is less well-understood. In this region, evapotranspiration (ET) must be reduced to reduce groundwater depletion. We used the APSIM cropping system model to examine whether conversion from recommended farmer practice (rFP, comprising puddled transplanted rice, alternate wetting and drying rice water management, rice straw removal, tillage for wheat) to a CA rice-wheat system would reduce ET in Punjab, north west India. We also used the model to identify the optimum system management taking into account effects on total cropping system rice equivalent yield (REY), components of the water balance and water productivity. Maximum REY (mean 14.6tha-1) occurred in systems with 5 June sowing of a popular long duration rice variety, with similar yield for rFP and CA. Irrigation input with CA was much lower (by 390mm) than with rFP, resulting in slightly higher irrigation water productivity (increased from 11.3 to 11.7kgha-1mm-1). However, changing to CA only reduced ET of the highest yielding system by 4% (55mm), and of other current practices (late May and early June sowing of medium and long duration varieties) by less than this. The only way to achieve a substantial reduction in ET was by growing short duration rice varieties in both the rFP and CA systems. However, with current short duration varieties, this came at the cost of both rice and system yields (system yield reduced by an average of about 1.8tha-1). This could be overcome by intensification to 3 crops per year in a CA rice-wheat-mung system (with short duration rice varieties), while still providing a substantial but smaller decrease in ET. This system also had considerable flexibility in rice sowing date, with similar system yields for sowings from 5 June to 15 July. These findings suggest that greater effort to increase the yield potential of short duration rice varieties is warranted. Field experimentation is needed to test the improved systems as suggested by the model simulations, particularly in terms of cropping system yield and ET, and alternatives to rice and wheat should also be evaluated. At the same time, spatial hydrological studies are needed to determine the sustainable level of ET from cropping systems that will allow matching of groundwater depletion and recharge. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The irrigated rice-wheat (RW) systems of north-west India are critical for food security. However, these systems are not sustainable due to over-exploitation of the groundwater resource on which they largely rely. Current farmer practice (FP) involves manual transplanting of rice into heavily tilled/puddled soil from 10 June to early July, prolonged periods of flooding, rice residue burning, and heavy tillage prior to sowing wheat. Inclusion of a short duration mungbean crop between wheat harvest and rice transplanting has also been promoted at times. Options for reducing irrigation input to the RW system include delaying transplanting until after the monsoon rains start (late June), switching to shorter duration rice varieties, and alternate wetting drying (AWD) water management for rice. However, the effect of such practices on groundwater depletion is not well-understood. Examining the effects of these options on cropping system yield and components of the water balance and water productivity is highly complex because of the need to consider the interactions between each crop in the system. Therefore, we used a cropping system model (APSIM) to compare the performance of RW systems with a range of rice transplanting dates (4 dates from 10 June to 10 August) and rice variety durations (long - 158d, medium - 144d, short - 125d), with and without mungbean in the system. The results suggest that changing from long to short duration varieties would reduce ET by around 250mm, more than enough to halt the groundwater decline, but with a reduction in rice-equivalent system yield of about 2.5tha-1 compared with current FP. On the other hand, inclusion of mungbean into the RW system results in much higher system yield than recommended farmer practice (by over 3tha-1), but the tradeoffs are much higher ET (by 250-300mm) and irrigation requirement (by 300-450mm). The results of this study suggest that more effort should be directed towards the development of higher-yielding, short duration rice varieties to reduce groundwater depletion of the RW system while maintaining yield, and that inclusion of short duration summer crops such as mungbean should not be recommended. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We evaluated the cost effectiveness of a decision-support system (DSS) developed for assessing in real time the risk of progression of the main fungal diseases (i.e., Septoria leaf blotch, powdery mildew, leaf rusts and Fusarium head blight) of winter wheat in the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg (GDL). The study was conducted in replicated field experiments located in four agricultural locations (representative of the main agro-ecological regions of the country) over a 10-year period (2003-2012). Three fungicide spray strategies were compared: a single DSS-based system and two commonly used spray practices in the GDL, a double- (2T) and a triple-spray (3T) treatment; there was also a non-treated control. In years with a high disease pressure, the DSS-based recommendation resulted in protection of the three upper leaves comparable to that achieved with the 2T and 3T treatments, with significant grain yield increases (. P>. 0.05) compared to the control (a 4 to 42% increase, depending on the site and year). Overall, the financial gain in treated plots compared with the control ranged from 3 to 16% at the study sites. Furthermore, in seasons when dry weather conditions precluded epidemic development, the DSS recommended no fungicide spray, reducing use of fungicide, and thus saving the cost of the product. The gain in yield for the 2T and 3T plots (compared with control) did not necessarily result in a financial gain during the duration of the experiment. This study demonstrates the potential advantages and profitability of using a DSS-based approach for disease management. © 2014.

AB  - Further increases in wheat yield potential could be achieved through a better understanding of the dynamics of floret primordia generation/degeneration, a process which has received little attention. We quantified genotypic variation among elite genotypes of the CIMCOG panel assembled by CIMMYT for its usefulness for wheat breeding. Ten genotypes, representing the range of variation for yield and its components of the whole panel, were grown under high-yielding conditions in NW Mexico for two growing seasons. The stage of development of floret primordia was determined 2-3 times weekly during stem elongation for apical, central and basal spikelets within the spike. The dynamics of floret initiation/death, and the resulting number of fertile florets, were determined for each spikelet position. We found that the variation in number of fertile florets within this elite germplasm was much more related to the survival of floret primordia than to the maximum number of florets initiated. As the two floret primordia most proximal to the rachis were almost always fertile and most distal florets (florets 6-8) were never fertile, the differences in number of fertile florets were clearly attributed to the differential developmental patterns of intermediate florets (floret primordia 3, 4 and 5, counted from the rachis, depending on the spikelet position). We found significant differences among elite germplasm in dynamics of floret development. Differences in floret survival seemed positively related to those in the length of the period of floret development: the longer the duration of floret development the higher the likelihood of that floret becoming fertile. It is proposed that this type of study may be instrumental for identifying prospective parents for further raising yield potential wheat breeding programmes. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Extreme weather events (frost and heat shock), already a significant challenge for grain producers, are predicted to increase under future climate scenarios. This paper reviews the current knowledge on the impacts of extreme heat (heat shock) and frost on crop production and how these impacts are incorporated into contemporary process-based crop models.Heat shock and frost result in a range of physiological impacts on wheat. Based on the literature we conclude that the greatest impacts on production from frost are associated with sterility and the abortion of formed grains around anthesis. While the greatest yield impact from heat shock are reduced grain number (sterility and abortion of grains) during anthesis to early grain filling; as well as the reduced duration of grain filling. Crop models generally did not consider the non-linear response in grain yield from a heat shock or frost event due to these key physiological impacts. While frost damage was incorporated into a number of models through winterkill functions, seedling death or advanced senescence, only the STICS model incorporated a potential decrease in grain number around anthesis. In contrast, heat shock was rarely considered within crop models, with only two examples found in the literature; (1) APSIM-Nwheat which incorporated accelerated senescence in response to extreme heat and (2) MONICA which incorporated a reduction in grain number and yield.We propose a conceptual model for the change in grain number and therefore yield in response to both a frost and heat shock event. We discuss the potential use of daily maximum/minimum temperatures, canopy temperature and heat/frost loads for determining crop response in the models. As well as identifying the need for a greater understanding on how the duration of temperature extremes impact on yield, as well as the cumulative effects of multiple heat/frost events and the interactions with other abiotic stresses including drought. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Staygreen quantitative trait loci (QTL) were introgressed into sorghum genetic backgrounds S-35 and R-16 generating 52 and 39 lines, respectively, to investigate the effects of staygreen introgression on stover fodder traits and grain-stover relationships. Trials were conducted in the post-rainy seasons 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 at ICRISAT headquarters using a fully irrigated control and a terminal water stress treatment. Stover fodder quality traits analyzed were nitrogen (N), in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), acid detergent fiber (ADF), acid detergent lignin (ADL) and neutral detergent solubles (NDS = 100.. NDF) using a combination of conventional nutritional laboratory analysis with Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). Significant (P<0.0001) differences were found among lines for grain and stover yield and all stover fodder quality traits under both water treatments. Water treatment had greater effects on grain and stover yields, which decreased between 20 and 32% under water stress, than on stover fodder quality traits which varied at most by 8% between treatments. Year had the greatest effect (F-value) on all traits followed by water treatment and line. Trade-offs between stover quality traits and grain yields were largely absent in both backgrounds. Year and water treatment had larger effects on stover fodder quality traits than QTL's but QTL's were highly significant (P<0.0001) except for stover N in S-35 background. Significant interactions between QTL, water treatment and year were largely absent. The effect of QTL on selected stover fodder quality traits was background dependent. In S-35 one staygreen QTL (StgB) increased stover IVOMD and grain and stover yield while no concomitant trait improvement was observed in background R-16. It is concluded that staygreen QTL can contribute to improving stover quality and grain and stover yield in a background-dependent manner. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cover crops and mulches can be used for increasing sustainability in winter cereal cropping systems. We performed a 2-year field experiment in Central Italy with the aim of finding a suitable spatial arrangement for durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) and subclover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) as a living mulch system in order to provide a high cereal grain yield and a sufficient subclover reseeding following the wheat harvest. Experimental treatments consisted of: (i) five cropping patterns [wheat and subclover mixed in the same row, with rows 15cm apart (same row); 2 rows of wheat and 1 row of subclover at a distance of 10cm between rows (narrow rows); 2 rows of wheat and 1 row of subclover with a distance of 10cm between the wheat rows and 17.5cm between the wheat and subclover rows (wide rows); durum wheat sole crop and subclover sole crop, both in rows 15cm apart]; (ii) two nitrogen fertilization levels (0 and 100kgha-1 of N); (iii) and two weed management levels (weed-free and weedy). The wheat grain yield was not reduced by the intercropped subclover in narrow rows, while it was around 14% lower in same row and wide rows compared to the one in the pure crop treatment. When intercropped with subclover, wheat was the competitively superior species and its competitive advantage was greater when it was closer to the legume and/or in presence of nitrogen fertilization. A strong negative relationship between wheat aggressivity and subclover seed production was observed. Following the wheat harvest, the legume reseeding was sufficient to regenerate a cover crop in the autumn of the second year regardless the spatial arrangement, even if the density of the subclover seedlings was almost twice in wide rows compared to the one in the same row. Although the intercropped systems were characterized by an increase in plant density compared to the sole crops (100% of wheat+50% of subclover), the competitive ability of the wheat-subclover system against the weeds was higher than the wheat sole crop only in narrow rows where a significant reduction of both weed density and weed biomass was observed. When the subclover is used as living mulch in durum wheat, a moderate separation between the two species could be a suitable spatial arrangement for obtaining an adequate wheat grain yield, ensuring satisfactory subclover reseeding, controlling the weeds more effectively. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Root system architecture influences nutrient and water uptake efficiency and thus plant growth and productivity. Root architecture traits conferring efficiency in capturing resources from soil are considered a key factor in crop breeding for enhanced water and nutrient uptake. Mechanical impedance such as soil compaction is common in the Western Australian wheatbelt, limiting root growth and crop productivity. The present study investigated root responses to subsoil compaction in two field trials at Wongan Hills (central wheatbelt) and Buntine (northern wheatbelt) in Western Australia. Substantial alteration to rooting patterns was observed in the commercial wheat cultivar Wyalkatchem and in narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) grown in sandy soils where compaction is common. The root systems of narrow-leafed lupin plants were dominated by a short and thickened taproot (10-26. cm depth, 7-14. mm root-collar diameter) and horizontally distributed primary lateral roots when compared to previous observations of the same genotypes under non-compacted soil conditions. Genotypic variability in root architecture traits among four wild genotypes and four commercial cultivars (Mandelup, Merrit, Quilinock and Tanjil) of narrow-leafed lupin was demonstrated. Taproot length, total root length, root surface area, root mass and root collar diameter were the most important root traits correlated to shoot yield (P<. 0.001). Deep ripping resulted in significantly improved rooting depth (up to 100. mm) and root distribution in wheat in the soil profile compared to non-ripped soil, where roots were restrained mainly in the top 0-30. cm layer. Root number, root length, root length density, root mass and grain yield of plants grown in deep-ripped soil were increased by 38, 36, 27, 24 and 19%, respectively, compared to those of non-ripped treatment. The data from this study form the basis for future research leading to selection and breeding for suitable root traits for soil constraints and provides information for alleviating management of compacted soil in deep sandy soils. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Previously published research reported a "synergistic effect" of corn (Zea mays L.) on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) water use efficiency (WUE) when corn (C) was the preceding crop for dryland cropping systems in the central Great Plains, i.e., less water was required to grow a unit of wheat (W) or proso millet (M) when corn was the preceding crop. A similar synergistic effect of field pea (Pisum sativum L.) for seed (P) or forage (FrP) on winter wheat water use and yield has also been reported. The purpose of this study was to examine a long-term cropping systems yield and water use data set in order to determine if WUE is altered by rotational sequence (i.e., previous crop). Yield and water use data (computed by water balance using neutron probe and time-domain reflectometry measurements) were acquired from a crop rotation study conducted at Akron, CO from 1996 to 2011 using the following rotation sequences: W-fallow (F), W-C-F, W-M-F, W-C-M, W-M, W-W-C-M,W-C-M-F, W-C-M-P, W-C-M-FrP and W-M-Sunflower (S, Helianthus annuus L.)-F. Water use efficiency was computed as grain yield divided by water use. Changes in WUE due to crop rotation were also evaluated based on slopes of water use/yield production functions. The analysis of these data did not support a conclusion that corn has a synergistic effect of improving WUE of wheat or millet production nor the conclusion that pea has a synergistic effect on wheat. © 2014.

AB  - The commercial use of glyphosate-resistant (also known as Roundup Ready®, GR or RR) soybean was initiated in 1996 in the United States. This genetically engineered crop now occupies 75.4millionha worldwide, 20.6million of which are in Brazil where it occupies 86% of the total area cropped with the legume. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is critical for economic sustainability of soybean in Brazil; therefore, to investigate the effects of the RR gene-using pairs of nearly isogenic cultivars-and herbicides on BNF, we conducted an extensive series of field experiments for three cropping seasons. The experiments were set up at six sites with five treatments, three pairs of nearly isogenic cultivars, and six replicates. The treatments consisted of: (T1) RR soybean+glyphosate; (T2) RR soybean+conventional herbicides; (T3) conventional parental soybean+conventional herbicides; (T4) RR soybean+hand weed control; and (T5) conventional parental soybean+hand weed control. Parameters of nodulation, plant biomass production, total N and ureide-N were evaluated at the V4 and R2 stages of growth, and grain yield and total N in grains were evaluated at crop maturity. Data were analyzed by ANOVA, analyses of contrasts, and multivariate analyses considering a pool of six variables, denominated as symbiotic efficiency (SyEf). The comparison of the pairs of non-transgenic and RR soybean cultivars showed that the transgenic trait negatively affected some BNF variables, but over a three-year period these effects had no significant impact on soybean grain yield. No consistent differences between glyphosate and conventional herbicide application were observed on BNF-associated parameters. When compared to conventional soybean and conventional herbicides, weed-management strategy with RR soybean and glyphosate did not affect symbiotic efficiency. In addition, at three sites, grain yields increased in the treatments with glyphosate and RR soybean over the three cropping seasons. The results from the multivariate analyses indicate that BNF and yield parameters were more affected by location, cropping season and cultivar than by the transgene, herbicides, or weed-management strategy. Despite the lack of effects of the transgene on yield in the three-year period, longer-term effects on BNF and N accumulation should be monitored. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Twenty elite varieties of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), primarily winter wheat, were grown with low and high supplies of nitrogen (N) in a field experiment at Rothamsted, southern England, in the season 2004-05. The aim was to quantify genetic variation in the uptake, partitioning and remobilisation of N in individual plant organs at extreme rates of N supply. The biggest contibutor to variation in plant and crop performance was 'N-rate' followed by 'growth stage' and then 'genotype'. At both N-rates, there was significant genetic variation in crop performance (grain yield, grain %N, total N-uptake and post-anthesis N-uptake), and in N contents of individual organs at anthesis and maturity, and in N remobilised from individual vegetative organs to the grain during grain-fill. Nitrogen was remobilised from all vegetative organs with very high levels of efficiency by all varieties (80-85%). Stem-N was a major N pool at anthesis probably due to the amounts of soluble N compounds in transit in the vascular system at this time. Despite the genetic variation in N-related plant parameters including stem-N, there were no strong correlations with grain yield and grain %N at a given N-rate. This was probably due to the narrow gene pool employed in this single-season study. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - In many parts of India intensive cultivation of safflower on Vertisols appears to have aggravated the problem of Fusarium wilt in safflower due to the soil borne fungus, Fusarium oxysporum Schlecht f. sp. carthami Klisiwiez and Houstan (FOC). In a long-term field experiment at Patancheru, India, we evaluated four diverse dryland cropping systems that each included safflower for their effectiveness in controlling Fusarium wilt in safflower. Sorghum (rainy season crop) and safflower (post-rainy season crop) were grown every alternate year as a two-year rotation with: (1) sorghum intercropped with pigeonpea (S/PP-S+SF); (2) cowpea intercropped with pigeonpea (C/PP-S+SF); (3) sorghum followed by chickpea (S+CP-S+SF); (4) sorghum followed by safflower (S+SF-S+SF). Continuous sorghum and safflower (S+SF-S+SF) had higher Fusarium wilt incidence of fully wilted safflower plants (31%) and a larger build-up of Fusarium propagules (1728cfug-1 of soil) than other cropping systems. The inclusion of a legume such as chickpea in the rotation (S+CP-S+SF) reduced wilt incidence (7% fully wilted plants) and the level of inoculum in the soil to about 800cfug-1. There was a significant increase in safflower seed yield and biomass yield (883 and 1733kgha-1, respectively) in the S+CP-S+SF rotation compared with the S+SF-S+SF rotation (605 and 1323kgha-1, respectively). Nitrogen application at rates of 0 to 120kgNha-1 had no effect on wilt incidence in safflower, but increased seed and biomass yield significantly. Intercrop rotations (S/PP-S+SF and C/PP-S+SF) were less effective to manage the Fusarium wilt. The Area Under Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC) was almost 10 times higher in the S+SF-S+SF rotation (2842) compared with the S+CP-S+SF rotation (297). Wilt progress throughout the season in all four systems was linear, with significant differences in intercepts and rates of disease progress among cropping systems; the rate of disease progress was significantly greater in the S+SF-S+SF rotation compared with the other three systems, which were similar. There was also a strong linear relationship between wilt incidence and the number of Fusarium propagules in the soil; regressions had the same slope but different intercepts in each system. There was no relationship between wilt incidence and seed yield; nitrogen had the largest effect on yields. A break from safflower cultivation for one year in the post-rainy season by growing chickpea as a sequential crop after sorghum, or as an intercrop with pigeonpea and sorghum, combined with higher rates of nitrogen application to safflower appears to be an effective strategy for reducing Fusarium populations and sustaining safflower yield. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Yellow rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. Tritici), powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) and wheat aphid (Sitobion avenae F.) infestation are three serious conditions that have a severe impact on yield and grain quality of winter wheat worldwide. Discrimination among these three stressors is of practical importance, given that specific procedures (i.e. adoption of fungicide and insecticide) are needed to treat different diseases and insects. This study examines the potential of hyperspectral sensor systems in discriminating these three stressors at leaf level. Reflectance spectra of leaves infected with yellow rust, powdery mildew and aphids were measured at the early grain filling stage. Normalization was performed prior to spectral analysis on all three groups of samples for removing differences in the spectral baseline among different cultivars. To obtain appropriate bands and spectral features (SFs) for stressor discrimination and damage intensity estimation, a correlation analysis and an independent t-test were used jointly. Based on the most efficient bands/SFs, models for discriminating stressors and estimating stressor intensity were established by Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) and partial least square regression (PLSR), respectively. The results showed that the performance of the discrimination model was satisfactory in general, with an overall accuracy of 0.75. However, the discrimination model produced varied classification accuracies among different types of diseases and insects. The regression model produced reasonable estimates of stress intensity, with an R2 of 0.73 and a RMSE of 0.148. This study illustrates the potential use of hyperspectral information in discriminating yellow rust, powdery mildew and wheat aphid infestation in winter wheat. In practice, it is important to extend the discriminative analysis from leaf level to canopy level. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Glyphosate, a broad-spectrum herbicide used for the non-selective control of weeds, inhibits 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of aromatic amino acids in the shikimic acid pathway in plants, fungi and bacteria, thus impairing the synthesis of proteins required for various life processes. Soybean genetically engineered to be glyphosate resistant (GR or Roundup Ready, RR) represents the most cultivated transgenic crop globally, including Brazil. There are concerns about the effects of RR transgenic soybean and of glyphosate on soil microbial communities and their functioning. Our study was designed to detect changes in soil microbial biomass-carbon (MB-C) and -nitrogen (MB-N) and in enzyme activities [beta-glucosidase (GLU) and acid phosphatase (PHO)] in a large set of field trials performed at six sites in Brazil for two cropping seasons. We evaluated the effects of the RR transgene, glyphosate and weed management (RR soybean. +. glyphosate vs. conventional soybean. +. conventional herbicides), with three pairs of nearly isogenic soybean cultivars evaluated per site. Soils were sampled from the 0-10. cm layer, between cropped lines, during the cropping seasons 2004/2005 and 2005/2006, at the R2 stage of soybean growth. Univariate and contrast analyses were performed in addition to multivariate analyses including all four microbial variables, and denominated as soil microbial variables (SMV). In general, microbial parameters and SMV were not affected by the transgene, type of herbicide or weed management. Differences were, rather, related to site, cropping season and cultivar. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The treatment of AHX or ICA was performed, in the early (seedling treatment, seed soaking treatment) and late (field treatment) developmental stages, and the resulting number of ears and grain weight per plant increased. AHX treatment increased the number of ears before tillering and ICA treatment increased the number after tillering. The high temperature during tillering stage in 2011 was a stress condition for wheat production in fields. The results indicated that AHX and ICA increased number of tillers and then number of ears, resulting in the increase of the grain yield even though under high-temperature stress. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Our objective was to investigate the determinants of genetic variation in N accumulation, N partitioning and N remobilization to the grain post-flowering and associations with flag-leaf senescence, grain yield and grain N% in 16 wheat cultivars grown under high N (HN) and low N (LN) conditions in the UK and France. Overall, cultivars ranged in leaf lamina N accumulation at anthesis from 5.32 to 8.03gNm-2 at HN and from 2.69 to 3.62gNm-2 at LN, and for the stem-and leaf-sheath from 5.45 to 7.25gNm-2 at HN and from 2.55 to 3.41gNm-2 at LN (P&lt;0.001). Cultivars ranged in N partitioning index (proportion of above-ground N in the crop component) at anthesis for the leaf lamina from 0.37 to 0.42 at HN and 0.34 to 0.40 at LN; and for the stem-and leaf-sheath from 0.39 to 0.43 at HN and from 0.35 to 0.41 at LN (P&lt;0.001). The amount of leaf lamina N remobilized post-anthesis was negatively associated with the duration of post-anthesis flag-leaf senescence amongst cultivars in all experiments under HN. In general, it was difficult to separate genetic differences in lamina N remobilization from those in lamina N accumulation at anthesis. Genetic variation in grain yield and grain N% (through N dilution effects) appeared to be mainly influenced by pre-anthesis N accumulation rather than post-anthesis N remobilization under high N conditions and under milder N stress (Sutton Bonington LN). Where N stress was increased (Clermont Ferrand LN), there was some evidence that lamina N remobilization was a determinant of genetic variation in grain N% although not of grain yield. Our results suggested that selection for lamina N accumulation at anthesis and lamina N remobilization post-anthesis may have value in breeding programmes aimed at optimizing senescence duration and improving grain yield, N-use efficiency and grain N% of wheat. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Genomic selection (GS) offers breeders the possibility of using historic data and unbalanced breeding trials to form training populations for predicting the performance of new lines. However, when using datasets that are unbalanced over time and space, there is increasing exposure to different genotype - environment combinations and interactions that may make predictions less accurate. Global cross-validated genomic prediction accuracies may be high when using large historic datasets but accuracies for individual years using a forward-prediction approach, or accuracies for individual locations, are often much lower. The objective of this study was to evaluate the overall accuracy of genomic predictions for untested genotypes using an unbalanced dataset to train a genomic selection model, and to explore ways of combining genomic selection and genotype-by-environment (G×E) interaction models to better target untested lines to different locations. Using the International Center for Maize and Wheat Improvement's (CIMMYT) Semi-Arid Wheat Yield Trials (SAWYT) we assessed the accuracy of genomic predictions and the potential to subset these nurseries using the concept of mega-environments (ME) adapted to a genomic selection context. We found that there was no difference in accuracy between models accounting for G×E interactions and global models. Data-driven methods of clustering locations based on similarities in genomic predictions also failed to improve accuracies within clusters. Using a simulation based on the empirical SAWYT data, we found that if there were different true genotypic values between clusters, there was an advantage to modeling G×E in prediction models. In the SAWYT dataset it appears that there is not a consistent pattern of genotype-by-environment interaction among the ME, and this dataset is not balanced enough to partition into new clusters that have predictive power. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - A better understanding of the effects of different source-sink ratio during the grain filling period on grain growth may be relevant in order to further increase cereal grain yield. The main objective of the present work was to determine the effect of different manipulations of the source-sink ratios in wheat and barley grown at four different environmental conditions on responsiveness of sinks (grain growth and yield) and sources (spike photosynthesis and water soluble carbohydrates in the stems). Four treatments were imposed 7 days after anthesis in two contrasting locations with low- and high-inputs conditions in wheat (cv. Soissons) and barley (cv. Sunrise): they were a control, a treatment removing all the spikelets from the upper half of the spikes (TS), and shadings decreasing incident radiation by 75% on the whole canopy (SW) or only on the leaves (having the top area of the meshes individual holes for each spike to be exposed to solar radiation, SL). As expected grain yield was closely related to grain number per m2. Average grain weight was reduced by shading treatments far more markedly in Sw than in SL. Interestingly, significant amounts of water soluble carbohydrates in the stems remained at maturity in SL and Sw treatments and spike photosynthesis in SL was consistently higher than in the unshaded controls in both species. These results may be an indication that wheat and barley are not source-limited during grain filling and that only when subjected to an extremely severe stress, grain size would be reduced due to lack of enough assimilates available to fill them. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Separation of the influencing factors (climate, soil, variety, management) affecting crop yield could provide valuable insight into how crop responds to climate change and how crop yield can be enhanced in the future. In this study, we reported the changes of climatic conditions, soil nutrients, variety types and management practices in the Taihu region (a typical rice growing zone) of east China in two periods (the 1980s and the 2000s), and simulated the changes of rice (Oryza sativa L.) yields under different scenarios by using the APSIM-Oryza model. The contributions of the influencing factors in rice growing system were also calculated. The results revealed that there was a warming trend in the rice growing period in the Taihu region. However, the precipitation and sunshine hours in the rice growing season showed a decreasing trend in the past 30 years. Compared with the soil nutrients in the 1980s, the mean concentrations of soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and potassium in the 2000s in the Taihu region were increased by 15.85%, 79.55%, 124.55% and 10.37%, respectively. The rice varieties in the 1980s could be described as the 'panicle weight type', while in the 2000s as the 'panicle number type'. The differences in management practices between 1980s and 2000s were mainly attributed to the fertilization and irrigation methods. From the 1980s to 2000s, the average rice yield in the Taihu region increased by 46.3%. The individual contribution of the climate change, soil improvement, variety updating and management progress on rice productivity was estimated as -19.5%, 12.7%, 21.7% and 34.6%, respectively. In addition, the spatial variation of rice yields in the whole region was reduced from 13.7% to 7.4% with the soil fertility improvement. The results indicate that future adaptations to climate change for rice yields would require either enhanced tolerance to high temperatures in the existing rice varieties or change in the current management practices, while balancing the soil fertility is a continuing process. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Sweet sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is a biofuel crop, which can be grown under tropical rainfed conditions without sacrificing food and fodder security. Three sweet sorghum cultivars (CSH 22 SS, NTJ 2 and ICSV 93046) with two row spacings (60 and 45cm) and six nitrogen levels (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150kgha-1) were grown on Vertisols during three post rainy (November to April) seasons at the ICRISAT center farm in Patancheru, India. The results showed that the row spacings (60 or 45cm) had no influence on performance of the cultivars. Sweet sorghum hybrid CSH 22 SS produced the highest green stalk yield (45.4Mgha-1) and grain yield (2.33Mgha-1) compared to NTJ 2 (32.66Mgha-1 and 1.70Mgha-1) and ICSV 93046 (38.44Mgha-1 and 2.03Mgha-1). Net economic return from CSH 22 SS (US$681ha-1) was also significantly higher than that from NTJ 2 (US$ 415ha-1) and ICSV 93046 (US$ 539ha-1). All cultivars responded to applied N up to 150kgha-1; however beyond 90kgha-1N rate, the increase in yield was insignificant. Estimated N use efficiency (NUE) values indicated that 90kgNha-1 was an optimum N level for sweet sorghum crop. Simulated soil water balance components revealed that reduction in total transpiration due to water stress was 20 to 45% compared to the no-stress. In case of water use efficiency, CSH 22 SS showed the highest economic returns per unit volume of water input. Based on these results, it is concluded that sweet sorghum hybrid CSH 22 SS at 90kgNha-1 is the best remunerative combination for maximizing yield, economic returns and resource use efficiency. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The two predominant systems for weed management in summer fallow are tillage with a field cultivator or multiple applications of broad spectrum herbicides with zero tillage. Both systems are based on substantial use of off farm resources. Our objective was to determine if strategic grazing of sheep may allow grain growers to more sustainably manage crop residues, volunteer crop, and other weeds during fallow periods. We conducted a study near Bozeman, Montana, USA, comparing three fallow weed management systems in two crop rotations from 2005 to 2008. Fallow weed management systems were conventional tillage, chemical-fallow (herbicide application), and sheep grazing. The crop rotations were summer fallow-spring wheat and summer fallow-winter wheat. In late fall, chemical-fallow treatment had greater residue cover and soil water content than did tilled- or grazed-fallow. At 0-15-cm depth, soil had lower bulk density in chemical- and tilled-fallow than in grazed fallow. Similarly, soil NO3-N, Ca, SO4-S concentrations and EC were lower following grazed-fallow than tilled-fallow, but Na concentration was higher following grazed-fallow than tilled- or chemical-fallow. Following spring and winter wheat, soil properties were not influenced by treatments. Grain yield was greater in winter wheat than in spring wheat but the trend reversed in protein concentration. Although soil properties varied among treatments, fallow management system had little influence on yield or quality of spring and winter wheat. Sheep grazing during fallow periods had limited impact on subsequent wheat yield and quality, and is a suitable practice for weed and residue management in wheat-fallow systems. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Wheat is Europe's dominant crop in terms of land use in the European Union (EU25). Most of this wheat area is sown in autumn, i.e., winter wheat in all EU25 countries, apart from southern Italy, southern Spain and most of Portugal, where spring wheat varieties are sown in late autumn. We evaluated the strengths and limitations of a regional implementation of the crop growth model WOFOST implemented in the Crop Growth Monitoring System (CGMS) for calculating yield gaps of autumn-sown wheat across the EU25. Normally, CGMS is used to assess growing conditions and to calculate timely and quantitative yield forecasts for the main crops in Europe. Plausibility of growth simulations by CGMS in terms of leaf area, total biomass and harvest index were evaluated and simulated yields were compared with those from other global studies. This study shows that water-limited autumn-sown wheat yields, being the most relevant benchmark for the largely rain fed wheat cultivation in Europe, are plausible for most parts of the EU25 and can be used to calculate yield gaps with some precision. In parts of southern Europe unrealistic simulated harvest index, maximum leaf area index and biomass values were found which are mainly caused by wrong values of phenology related crop parameters. Furthermore CGMS slightly underestimates potential and water-limited yields, which calls for a calibration using new field experiments with recent cultivars. Estimated yield gap is between 2 and 4tha-1 in main parts of the EU25, is smaller north-western Europe and highest in Portugal. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Genetic improvement of crop yields under potential (Yp) and water scarce conditions (Yw) will be an important avenue to improved food security over the next four decades, at the end of which projected demand for food, feed and biofuel feedstock is expected to level out. Current measured relative rates of improvement in Yp and Yw for the three main cereal crops (maize, wheat and rice) in many cropping systems in the world are mostly well below the 1.16-1.31%y-1 rates required to meet projected demand for cereals in 2050. These relative rates can be expected to fall further if the current absolute rates of yield improvement continue unchanged and/or the current indications of stagnation in yield improvement for some crops in some regions of the world become widespread. This review assesses the available evidence for unexploited opportunities for enhancing current rates of genetic improvement for Yp and Yw, and examines some substantive proposals for achieving the same end through genetic engineering of photosynthesis, above-ground ideotype design, and improvement of root capacity for water uptake. Because time is of the essence, special attention is paid to the time scales required to progress potentially useful traits through to proof of concept under field conditions, from there to farmer-ready cultivars, and for widespread adoption by farmers of the improved cultivars. The requirements of breeders for inclusion of potentially important traits into the conventional breeding process are outlined and the value of molecular breeding tools as aids to genetic improvement of simple and complex traits is considered. Intellectual property and regulatory requirements are taken as additional potential drags on the rates of adoption into the breeding process of useful traits and/or to the free flow of information between research teams. Main conclusions are: (a) there are some unexploited opportunities to improve Yp or Yw in some crops and/or cropping systems; (b) exploitation of these opportunities could be hastened by increasing funding for focussed research and by identifying and eliminating or reducing drags at various stages of the idea to farmer-ready cultivar chain; (c) the time-scales required for major improvements in yield in farmer-ready cultivars through genetic engineering or ideotype realisation are likely to be measured in decades rather than years; (d) current and expected future relative rates of progress in Yp and Yw are a matter of real concern and are insufficient to meet projected demand for cereals by 2050. Possible step changes in Yp or Yw powered by genetic improvements such as exploitation of hybrid vigour in rice or hypothetical successes in the genetic engineering of photosynthesis are unlikely to change this outlook. The pessimistic assessments embodied in the last two conclusions should not obscure the fact that without continued investment in the search for sources of genetic improvement and development of aids to breeding, the unmet demands for cereals in 2050 will be even greater. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To feed a growing world population in the coming decades, agriculture must strive to reduce the gap between the yields that are currently achieved by farmers (Ya) and those potentially attainable in rainfed farming systems (Yw). The first step towards reducing yield gaps (Yg) is to obtain realistic estimates of their magnitude and their spatial and temporal variability. In this paper we describe a new yield gap assessment framework. The framework uses statistical yield and cropping area data, remotely sensed data, cropping system simulation and GIS mapping to calculate wheat yield gaps at scales from 1.1km cells to regional. The framework includes ad hoc on-ground testing of the calculated yield gaps. This framework was applied to wheat in the Wimmera region of Victoria, Australia. Estimated Yg over the whole Wimmera region varied annually from 0.63 to 4.12Mgha-1with an average of 2.00Mgha-1. Expressed as a relative yield (Y%) the range was 26.3-77.9% with an average of 52.7%. Similarly large spatial variability was described in a Wimmera yield gap map. Such maps can be used to show where efforts to bridge the yield gap are likely to have the biggest impacts. Bridging the exploitable yield gap in the Wimmera region by increasing average Y% to 80% would increase average annual wheat production from 1.09Mtonnes to 1.65Mtonnes. Model estimates of Yw and Yg were compared with data from crop yield contests, experimental variety trials, and on-farm water use and yields. These alternative approaches agreed well with the modelling results, indicating that the proposed framework provided a robust and widely applicable method of determining yield gaps. Its successful implementation requires that: (1) Ya as well as the area and geospatial distribution of wheat cropping are well defined; (2) there is a crop model with proven performance in the local agro-ecological zone; (3) daily weather and soil data (such as PAWC) required by crop models are available throughout the area; and (4) local agronomic best practice is well defined. © 2012.

AB  - World population will increase 35% by 2050, which may require doubling crop yields on existing farm land to minimize expansion of agriculture into remaining rainforests, wetlands, and grasslands. Whether this is possible depends on closing the gap between yield potential (Yp, yield without pest, disease, nutrient or water stresses, or Yw under water-limited rainfed conditions) and current average farm yields in both developed and developing countries. Quantifying the yield gap is therefore essential to inform policies and prioritize research to achieve food security without environmental degradation. Previous attempts to estimate Yp and Yw at a global level have been too coarse, general, and opaque. Our purpose was to develop a protocol to overcome these limitations based on examples for irrigated rice in China, irrigated and rainfed maize in the USA, and rainfed wheat in Germany. Sensitivity analysis of simulated Yp or Yw found that robust estimates required specific information on crop management, +15 years of observed daily climate data from weather stations in major crop production zones, and coverage of 40-50% of total national production area. National Yp estimates were weighted by potential production within 100-km of reference weather stations. This protocol is appropriate for countries in which crops are mostly grown in landscapes with relatively homogenous topography, such as prairies, plains, large valleys, deltas and lowlands, which account for a majority of global food crop production. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that average farm yields plateau when they reach 75-85% of estimated national Yp, which appears to occur for rice in China and wheat in Germany. Prediction of when average crop yields will plateau in other countries is now possible based on the estimated Yp or Yw ceiling using this protocol. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The North China Plain (NCP) is the most important wheat production area in China, producing about two-thirds of China's total wheat output. To meet the associated increase in China's food demand with the expected growth in its already large population of 1.3 billion and diet changes, wheat production in the NCP needs to increase. Because of the farmland reduction due to urbanization, strategies for increasing wheat production in the NCP should be targeted at increasing current yields. To identify options for increasing wheat yields, we analyzed the yield potentials and yield gaps using the EPIC (Environment Policy Integrated Climate) model, Kriging interpolation techniques, GIS and average farm yields at county level. As most (ca. 82%) of the winter wheat in the NCP is irrigated, it is justified to use potential yield as the benchmark of the yield gap assessment. Wheat potential yields simulated with EPIC using daily weather data from 1960 to 2007 at 43 representative sites varied from 6.6 to 9.1tha-1 in the NCP, generally increasing from north to south associated with decreasing low temperature stress. Based on the county-level data (2004-2007), the actual wheat yield varied between 2.4 and 7.7tha-1, while the yield gap was between 0.6 and 5.3tha-1 (7-69% of the potential yield) across the NCP and decreased with increase of actual yields (R2=0.82). For the entire region, the weighted average actual yield was 5.7tha-1, while the yield gap was 2.7tha-1 or 32% of the potential yield. Using 80% of the potential yield as an exploitable level, the average actual wheat yield in the NCP could be increased by 1.0tha-1 or 18%. The results provide an indication of the possibilities to increase wheat yields in the NCP. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Double-cropping using the wheat-soybean sequence is a common practice in Argentina to promote the intensification of crops within rotations. However, the late release of the fields by a delayed harvest time in wheat determines soybean yield penalizations. In this context, barley could represent a better option than wheat preceding soybean in the crop rotation since there is some evidence that finishes its cycle earlier than wheat. However, it is not clear which period of barley shortens crop cycle allowing an earlier field release than wheat. The objectives of this study were to compare wheat and barley in terms of (i) field release and (ii) grain weight determination through the analysis of their physiological mechanisms. Field experiments during two consecutive growing seasons testing five different environments (three sowing dates in 2007 and two in 2008) were carried out to analyze the duration of different ontogenic periods and the attributes (dry matter and water dynamics) determining grain weight during the grain-filling period in wheat and barley. Early flowering time was the main cause of the early field release by barley as the grain filling and drying period were similar in both species. A strong relationship was found between dry matter and water dynamics in both species. Barley reached a higher maximum water content than wheat and also achieved physiological maturity with higher moisture concentration than wheat (48% and 39%, respectively). Barley showed a slight increase in grain weight, respect to wheat, due to a source:sink ratio enhancement (4% and 9% for wheat and barley, respectively). These data show an opposite response to that of Mediterranean, Australian and UK environments, where barley was under stronger sink limitation than wheat during the grain-filling period. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Near-isogenic lines (NILs) of winter wheat varying for alleles for reduced height (Rht), gibberellin (GA) response and photoperiod insensitivity (Ppd-D1a) in cv. Mercia background (rht (tall), Rht-B1b, Rht-D1b, Rht-B1c, Rht8c+. Ppd-D1a, Rht-D1c, Rht12) and cv. Maris Widgeon (rht (tall), Rht-D1b, Rht-B1c) backgrounds were compared to investigate main effects and interactions with tillage (plough-based, minimum-, and zero-tillage) over two years. Both minimum- and zero- tillage were associated with reduced grain yields allied to reduced harvest index, biomass accumulation, interception of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and plant populations. Grain yields were optimized at mature crop heights of around 740. mm because this provided the best compromise between harvest index which declined with height, and above ground biomass which increased with height. Improving biomass with height was due to improvements in both PAR interception and radiation-use efficiency. Optimum height for grain yield was unaffected by tillage system or GA-sensitivity. After accounting for effects of height, GA insensitivity was associated with increased grain yields due to increased grains per spike, which was more than enough to compensate for poorer plant establishment and lower mean grain weights compared to the GA-sensitive lines. Although better establishment was possible with GA-sensitive lines, there was no evidence that this effect interacted with tillage method. We find, therefore, little evidence to question the current adoption of wheats with reduced sensitivity to GA in the UK, even as tillage intensity lessens. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the last three decades, the no-tillage system (NT) has provided environmental and economic advantages for farming in southern Brazil, especially when associated with crop rotation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of different tillage and cropping systems on the grain yields of soybean, maize and wheat, in a 23-year experiment established on an Oxisol in the southern region of Brazil. The experiment was carried out in randomized block experimental design with four replications. The treatments consisted of three tillage systems [NT, NT with chiseling every three years (NTC), and conventional tillage (CT)] and two cropping systems [an annual crop sequence with wheat in the winter and soybean in the summer, designated as crop succession (CS), and a 4-year crop rotation with the following species in winter-summer, respectively: white lupine-maize; black oat-soybean; wheat-soybean; and wheat-soybean (CR)]. Soybean yields were correlated to the water requirement satisfaction index (WRSI) estimated for the soybean reproductive period. With few exceptions, the NT showed higher soybean yields in relation to CT from the 7th year of the experiment onwards, especially under crop rotation and in growing seasons with lower water availability expressed by lower WRSI values. The percentage of NT soybean yield advantage over CT increased consistently over the time, and this increase was greater in CR than in CS, reaching on average 23%. The yields of wheat and maize were not influenced by the tillage systems, but the wheat yields were increased by crop rotation. In the most of the growing seasons, the soil chiseling, at every three years, did not increase significantly the yields of soybean, maize and wheat. Crop rotation and NT, allowed high and stable crop yields, especially under water-stress conditions. Results indicate the need of minimizing soil disturbance and diversifying cropping system for sustainable grain production in southern Brazil. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Previous work with crops used for livestock forage and grain production has shown that crop regrowth after grazing is influenced by grazing pressure, shoot dry matter (DM) removed and rainfall, though such findings are typically obtained using limited growing seasons. The aims of this paper were four-fold: (1) validate a wheat-grazing crop model (WHTGRAZ), (2) determine the effect of grazing regime on grain yield at the same grazing pressure, (3) determine the relationship between grazing intensity, yield and rainfall, and (4) determine how shoot DM at the start of grazing influences total DM consumption and grain yield. The ability of WHTGRAZ to predict post-grazing shoot DM accumulation was as good as or better than its ability to predict that of ungrazed crops. Aims 2-4 were investigated by simulating grazing while crops were vegetative. When the number of grazing days per hectare was predefined, yield of crops subjected to light grazing intensities for long periods were similar to yields of crops subjected to high grazing intensities for short periods. When the number of grazing days per hectare was unlimited and grazing was terminated only upon reaching a minimum shoot DM or maximum development stage, more grazing was obtained with lower grazing intensities. Irrespective of grazing intensity, crop yields were generally equal to or greater than those of ungrazed crops in years when growing season rainfall was low, but the converse occurred when growing season rainfall high. In very wet years, delaying the start of light intensity grazing decreased total shoot DM consumption and increased yield. Alternatively, delaying the start of high intensity grazing increased shoot DM consumed and decreased yield. Two major conclusions were deducted from this study. First, grazing of rainfed wheat at relatively light intensities for long durations allows more regrowth to occur during the grazing interval. This both increases removal of shoot DM and is less likely to penalise yield. Second, the probability of grazing increasing crop productivity is greatest in years with low rainfall, regardless of grazing intensity. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease and deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination of wheat grains depend on multiple factors, above all climatic conditions, but also agronomic factors such as crop rotation, debris management, variety susceptibility and fungicide applications. Although it is generally believed that multiple strategies are more successful than a single strategy, only a few studies have shown the quantitative effect of combining multiple strategies.Field experiments have been conducted over three growing seasons in three sites in Northern Italy to evaluate the effect of previous crop residue management through tillage, variety susceptibility and triazole fungicide application on common wheat, according to a full factorial scheme. The following parameters were analyzed: FHB severity, grain yield and DON contamination.The collected data have clearly shown a close interaction between the factors involved in FHB severity and DON content, while the interactions were less significant for grain yield. In all nine trials, the DON contamination was significantly affected by the interaction of at least two of the compared factors, while the interaction between all three factors involved was significant in four trials. The most favourable scenario to avoid DON contamination (ploughing, moderately resistant variety, triazole application at heading) reduced the DON content by 97% compared to the worst one (direct sowing, susceptible variety, no fungicide application).Since the interaction between the agricultural practices have shown a synergistic effect, integrated multiple strategies, in areas characterized by a high risk of FHB, can be considered the very effective management means of reducing FHB and DON contamination in wheat. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Great Plains region of the United States is an area of widespread dryland crop production, with wheat being the dominant crop. Precipitation in the region ranges from 300 to 500. mm annually, with the majority of precipitation falling during hot summer months. The prevailing cropping system is a two-year rotation of wheat and summer fallow. The adoption of no-till practices has resulted in greater precipitation storage and use efficiency, which has led to greater cropping intensity, higher productivity, more diverse crop rotations, and improvements in soil properties. In Colorado, for example, a no-till rotation of winter wheat-maize-fallow increased total annualized grain yield by 75% compared to winter wheat-summer fallow. Soil erosion was reduced to just 25% of that from a conventional tillage wheat-summer fallow system. The primary challenge with reducing fallow frequency is the increase in yield variability and risk of crop failure. Improved approaches for choosing crop or fallow are being developed based on soil water content and forecasted weather. Development of alternative crops, crop rotations, and integrated livestock systems that are sustainable from both economic and ecological perspectives is an on-going effort. Other research is addressing adaptation of cropping practices to climate change and the potential for dryland biomass crop production for the developing biofuel industry. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Groundnut haulm has a great value as feed stock in the semi-arid tropics. Two-hundred-two and 194 cultivars of groundnut grown under intermittent water stress and fully irrigated treatment for two consecutive years at ICRISAT (2008/2009 and 2009/2010) in Patancheru in India were investigated for haulm fodder quality traits and for potential trade-offs between pod or haulm yield and haulm fodder traits. Highly significant (P<. 0.0001) cultivars-dependent variations were found for a range of laboratory haulm fodder quality traits. Haulm nitrogen contents ranged from 1.94 to 2.88% and from 1.81 to 2.66% while in vitro digestibility ranged from 57.3 to 64.3% and from 59.5 to 64.2% under water restriction and fully irrigated conditions, respectively. Under fully irrigated conditions haulm nitrogen content and in vitro digestibility were mildly, but significantly inversely, related to pod yields with the two haulms traits accounting for 5 and 4% of the variations in pod yields. However, potential trade-offs between haulm traits and pod yields became more pronounced under water stress where variations in haulm nitrogen content and in vitro digestibility accounted for 40 and 28% of the variations in pod yields, respectively. For haulm nitrogen content and in vitro digestibility no significant interactions were observed between cultivar and treatment suggesting stability of haulm fodder traits across poorer and better water management practices. These results demonstrate that breeding for fodder traits in groundnut can be parallel to breeding for productivity traits, although careful choice of cultivars with high fodder trait value would be needed under water stress conditions. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Grasspea (GP) (Lathyrus sativus) is a drought-tolerant legume that can be grown for forage and grain. It has potential value to be used as a nitrogen-fixing crop in dryland rotations with non-legume grain crops. However, the agronomy of GP for the Central Great Plains region have not been investigated. The objective of this research was to compare the grain and biomass yield, as well as N accumulation of GP relative to field pea (FP) in two planting configurations. We carried out a 3-year field experiment to compare dryland GP with Admiral yellow field pea (Pisum sativum) in two configurations: (1) a wide row spacing with lower population (WL) with 76-cm rows with 75. kg seeds planted per ha, and (2) a narrower row spacing with a higher population (NH) with 19-cm rows with 136. kg seeds planted per ha. We measured the biomass, grain yield, N content, and soil water use. Our results show that the NH treatment out-yielded the WL treatment in both pea species. The GP had higher yield than FP on the lowest yielding year, while FP yielded better when overall yields were higher. Biomass production was also higher for the NH configuration, and GP was a higher biomass producer than FP over the 3-year study. The GP had higher N concentration in shoots and seed compared to FP, indicating higher N-fixing capacity. The FP matured faster than GP, and had marginally higher grain water use efficiency than GP. Our results show that GP is a viable alternative legume for the Central Great Plains, with comparable yields in low precipitation years. However, the longer growing season required by GP to mature has water use implications in years with reduced water availability in mid to late summer. © 2011.

AB  - Ecophysiological models are widely used to forecast potential impacts of climate change on future agricultural productivity and to examine options for adaptation by local stakeholders and policy makers. However, protocols followed in such assessments vary to such an extent that they constrain cross-study syntheses and increase the potential for bias in projected impacts. We reviewed 221 peer-reviewed papers that used crop simulation models to examine diverse aspects of how climate change might affect agricultural systems. Six subject areas were examined: target crops and regions; the crop model(s) used and their characteristics; sources and application of data on [CO2] and climate; impact parameters evaluated; assessment of variability or risk; and adaptation strategies. Wheat, maize, soybean and rice were considered in approximately 170 papers. The USA (55 papers) and Europe (64 papers) were the dominant regions studied. The most frequent approach used to simulate response to CO2 involved adjusting daily radiation use efficiency (RUE) and transpiration, precluding consideration of the interacting effects of CO2, stomatal conductance and canopy temperature, which are expected to exacerbate effects of global warming. The assumed baseline [CO2] typically corresponded to conditions 10-30 years earlier than the date the paper was accepted, exaggerating the relative impacts of increased [CO2]. Due in part to the diverse scenarios for increases in greenhouse gas emissions, assumed future [CO2] also varied greatly, further complicating comparisons among studies. Papers considering adaptation predominantly examined changes in planting dates and cultivars; only 20 papers tested different tillage practices or crop rotations. Risk was quantified in over half the papers, mainly in relation to variability in yield or effects of water deficits, but the limited consideration of other factors affecting risk beside climate change per se suggests that impacts of climate change were overestimated relative to background variability. A coordinated crop, climate and soil data resource would allow researchers to focus on underlying science. More extensive model intercomparison, facilitated by modular software, should strengthen the biological realism of predictions and clarify the limits of our ability to forecast agricultural impacts of climate change on crop production and associated food security as well as to evaluate potential for adaptation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forages could be used to diversify reduced and no-till dryland cropping systems from the traditional wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow system in the semiarid central Great Plains. Forages present an attractive alternative to grain and seed crops because of greater water use efficiency and less susceptibility to potentially devastating yield reductions due to severe water stress during critical growth stages. However, farmers need a simple tool to evaluate forage productivity under widely varying precipitation conditions. The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify the relationship between crop water use and dry matter (DM) yield for soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill), (2) evaluate changes in forage quality that occur as harvest date is delayed, and (3) determine the range and distribution of expected DM yields in the central Great Plains based on historical precipitation records. Forage soybean was grown under a line-source gradient irrigation system to impose a range of water availability conditions at Akron, CO. Dry matter production was linearly correlated with water use resulting in a production function slope of 21.2kgha-1mm-1. The slope was much lower than previously reported for forage production functions for triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack) and millet (Setaria italic L. Beauv.), and only slightly lower than slopes previously reported for corn (Zea mays L.) and pea (Pisum sativa L.) forage. Forage quality was relatively stable during the last four weeks of growth, with small declines in crude protein (CP) concentration. Values of CP concentration and relative feed value indicated that forage soybean was of sufficient quality to be used for dairy feed. A standard seed variety of maturity group VII was found to be similar (in both productivity and quality) to a variety designated as a forage type. The probability of obtaining a break-even yield of at least 4256kgha-1 was 90% as determined from long-term precipitation records used with the production function. The average estimated DM yield was 5890kgha-1 and ranged from 2437 to 9432kgha-1. Regional estimates of mean forage soybean DM yield ranged from 4770kgha-1 at Fort Morgan, CO to 6911kgha-1 at Colby, KS. Forage soybean should be considered a viable alternative crop for dryland cropping systems in the central Great Plains. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In bread wheat, high grain protein content (GPC) determines nutritional value, processing properties and quality of the end-product. In view of this, marker-assisted selection (MAS) was performed for introgression of a major gene for high GPC (Gpc-B1) into 10 wheat genotypes. As a result, 124 BC3F5/F6 progenies with Gpc-B1 were developed and evaluated in multi-location field trials. Significant interaction of Gpc-B1 with the recipient parent genotypes and the environment was noticed. However, a total of seven MAS-derived progenies with significantly higher GPC (14.83-17.85%) than their recipient parental genotypes and having no yield penalty were obtained. In these selected progenies, no significant negative correlation of grain yield with GPC (%) or protein yield was observed suggesting that GPC could be improved without yield penalty. This study thus suggested that MAS in combination with phenotypic selection is a useful strategy for development of wheat genotypes with high GPC associated with no loss in yield. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - No-till dryland winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow systems in the central Great Plains have more water available for crop production than the traditional conventionally tilled winter wheat-fallow systems because of greater precipitation storage efficiency. That additional water is used most efficiently when a crop is present to transpire the water, and crop yields respond positively to increases in available soil water. The objective of this study was to evaluate yield, water use efficiency (WUE), precipitation use efficiency (PUE), and net returns of cropping systems where crop choice was based on established crop responses to water use while incorporating a grass/broadleaf rotation. Available soil water at planting was measured at several decision points each year and combined with three levels of expected growing season precipitation (70, 100, 130% of average) to provide input data for water use/yield production functions for seven grain crops and three forage crops. The predicted yields from those production functions were compared against established yield thresholds for each crop, and crops were retained for further consideration if the threshold yield was exceeded. Crop choice was then narrowed by following a rule which rotated summer crops (crops planted in the spring with most of their growth occurring during summer months) with winter crops (crops planted in the fall with most of their growth occurring during the next spring) and also rotating grasses with broadleaf crops. Yields, WUE, PUE, value-basis precipitation use efficiency ($PUE), gross receipts, and net returns from the four opportunity cropping (OC) selection schemes were compared with the same quantities from four set rotations [wheat-fallow (conventional till), (WF (CT)); wheat-fallow (no-till), (WF (NT)); wheat-corn (Zea mays L.)-fallow (no-till), (WCF); wheat-millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) (no-till), (WM)]. Water use efficiency was greater for three of the OC selection schemes than for any of the four set rotations. Precipitation was used more efficiently using two of the OC selection schemes than using any of the four set rotations. Of the four OC cropping decision methods, net returns were greatest for the method that assumed average growing season precipitation and allowed selection from all possible crop choices. The net returns from this system were not different from net returns from WF (CT) and WF (NT). Cropping frequency can be effectively increased in dryland cropping systems by use of crop selection rules based on water use/yield production functions, measured available soil water, and expected precipitation. © 2010.

AB  - Carbon sequestration in tropical soils has potential for mitigating global warming and increasing agricultural productivity. We analyzed 26 long-term experiments (LTEs) in different agro-climatic zones (ACZs) of India to assess the potential and cost of C sequestration. Data on initial and final soil organic C (SOC) concentration in the recommended N, P and K (NPK); recommended N, P and K plus farmyard manure (NPK+FYM) and unfertilized (control) treatments were used to calculate carbon sequestration potential (CSP) i.e., capacity to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) by increasing SOC stock, under different nutrient management scenarios. In most of the LTEs wheat equivalent yields were higher in the NPK+FYM treatment than the NPK treatment. However, partial factor productivity (PFP) was more with the NPK treatment. Average SOC concentration of the control treatment was 0.54%, which increased to 0.65% in the NPK treatment and 0.82% in the NPK+FYM treatment. Compared to the control treatment the NPK+FYM treatment sequestered 0.33MgCha-1yr-1 whereas the NPK treatment sequestered 0.16MgCha-1yr-1. The CSP in different nutrient management scenarios ranged from 2.1 to 4.8MgCha-1 during the study period (average 16.9 yr) of the LTEs. In 17 out of 26 LTEs, the NPK+FYM treatment had higher SOC and also higher net return than that of the NPK treatment. In the remaining 9 LTEs SOC sequestration in the NPK+FYM treatment was accomplished with decreased net return suggesting that these are economically not attractive and farmers have to incur into additional cost to achieve C sequestration. The feasibility of SOC sequestration in terms of availability of FYM and other organic sources has been discussed in the paper. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Under semiarid Mediterranean conditions irrigated maize has been associated to diffuse nitrate pollution of surface and groundwater. Cover crops grown during winter combined with reduced N fertilization to maize could reduce N leaching risks while maintaining maize productivity. A field experiment was conducted testing two different cover crop planting methods (direct seeding versus seeding after conventional tillage operations) and four different cover crops species (barley, oilseed rape, winter rape, and common vetch), and a control (bare soil). The experiment started in November 2006 after a maize crop fertilized with 300kgNha-1 and included two complete cover crop-maize rotations. Maize was fertilized with 300kgNha-1 at the control treatment, and this amount was reduced to 250kgNha-1 in maize after a cover crop. Direct seeding of the cover crops allowed earlier planting dates than seeding after conventional tillage, producing greater cover crop biomass and N uptake of all species in the first year. In the following year, direct seeding did not increase cover crop biomass due to a poorer plant establishment. Barley produced more biomass than the other species but its N concentration was much lower than in the other cover crops, resulting in higher C:N ratio (&gt;26). Cover crops reduced the N leaching risks as soil N content in spring and at maize harvest was reduced compared to the control treatment. Maize yield was reduced by 4Mgha-1 after barley in 2007 and by 1Mgha-1 after barley and oilseed rape in 2008. The maize yield reduction was due to an N deficiency caused by insufficient N mineralization from the cover crops due to a high C:N ratio (barley) or low biomass N content (oilseed rape) and/or lack of synchronization with maize N uptake. Indirect chlorophyll measurements in maize leaves were useful to detect N deficiency in maize after cover crops. The use of vetch, winter rape and oilseed rape cover crops combined with a reduced N fertilization to maize was efficient for reducing N leaching risks while maintaining maize productivity. However, the reduction of maize yield after barley makes difficult its use as cover crop. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The last two decades are witnessing a decline in the growth trend of cereal yields in many European countries. The present study analyses yield trends in France using various sources of data: national and regional statistics, scattered trials, results of agroclimatic models using climatic data. Effects in genetic changes through breeding, agronomy and climate are investigated as possible causes. Our results show that genetic progress has not declined but it was partly counteracted, from 1990 on, by climate change which in general is unfavorable to cereal yields in temperate climates because of heat stress during grain filling and drought during stem elongation. We cannot however, from the decade beginning in 2000, rule out agronomic causes, related to policy and economy, in particular the decline of legumes in the cereal rotations, replaced by oilseed rape and to a lesser extent the decrease in nitrogen fertilization. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The CERES-sorghum module of the Decision Support System for Agro-Technological Transfer (DSSAT) model was calibrated for sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) using data from sorghum grown with adequate water and nitrogen and evaluated with data from several N rates trials in Navrongo, Ghana with an overall modified internal efficiency of 0.63. The use of mineral N fertilizer was found to be profitable with economically optimal rates of 40 and 80kgNha-1 for more intensively managed homestead fields and less intensively managed bush fields respectively. Agronomic N use efficiency varied from 21 to 37kggrainkg-1N for the homestead fields and from 15 to 49kggrainkg-1N in the bush fields. Simulated grain yield for homestead fields at 40kgNha-1 application was equal to yield for bush fields at 80kgNha-1. Water use efficiency generally increased with increased mineral N rate and was greater for the homestead fields compared with the bush fields. Grain yield per unit of cumulative evapo-transpiration (simulated) was consistently higher compared with yield per unit of cumulative precipitation for the season, probably because of runoff and deep percolation. In the simulation experiment, grain yield variability was less with mineral N application and under higher soil fertility (organic matter) condition. Application of mineral N reduced variability in yield from a CV of 37 to 11% in the bush farm and from 17 to 7% in the homestead fields. The use of mineral fertilizer and encouraging practices that retain organic matter to the soil provide a more sustainable system for ensuring crop production and hence food security. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The concept of aerobic culture is to save water resource while maintaining high productivity in irrigated rice ecosystem. This study compared nitrogen (N) accumulation and radiation use efficiency (RUE) in the biomass production of rice crops in aerobic and flooded cultures. The total water input was 800-1300 mm and 1500-3500 mm in aerobic culture and flooded culture, respectively, and four high-yielding rice cultivars were grown with a high rate of N application (180 kg N ha-1) at two sites (Tokyo and Osaka) in Japan in 2007 and 2008. The aboveground biomass and N accumulation at maturity were significantly higher in aerobic culture (17.2-18.5 t ha-1 and 194-233 kg N ha-1, respectively) than in flooded culture (14.7-15.8 t ha-1 and 142-173 kg N ha-1) except in Tokyo in 2007, where the surface soil moisture content frequently declined. The crop maintained higher N uptake in aerobic culture than in flooded culture, because in aerobic culture there was a higher N accumulation rate in the reproductive stage. RUE in aerobic culture was comparable to, or higher than, that in flooded culture (1.27-1.50 g MJ-1 vs. 1.20-1.37 g MJ-1), except in Tokyo in 2007 (1.30 g MJ-1 vs. 1.37 g MJ-1). These results suggest that higher biomass production in aerobic culture was attributable to greater N accumulation, leading to higher N concentration (N%) than in flooded culture. Cultivar differences in response to water regimes were thought to reflect differences in mainly (1) early vigor and RUE under temporary declines in soil moisture in aerobic culture and (2) the ability to maintain high N% in flooded culture. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The introduction of a living cover crop during a cash crop growth cycle (relay intercropping) and its maintenance after the cash crop harvest may help to preserve biodiversity, increase soil organic matter content and carbon sequestration and provide other ecosystem services, such as natural pest regulation or nutrient recycling, by increasing useful biotic interactions within the agroecosystem. We studied the impact of various approaches to manage a red fescue cover crop in a winter wheat crop in terms of light, water and nitrogen competition, using the STICS crop model adapted for intercropping. The STICS model for wheat/fescue intercropping was first evaluated on two years of experimental data obtained in the field. It gave satisfactory statistical results for the prediction of dry matter, leaf area index (LAI) and nitrogen accumulation in the two species, and for nitrogen and water dynamics in the soil. By simulating unmeasured variables, such as transpiration, the model improves our understanding of the performance of the intercrop in the field. For example, we showed that the intercropping system was more efficient that wheat grown as a sole crop, in terms of nitrogen accumulation and decreasing soil nitrogen levels before the leaching period. However, it also resulted in lower wheat yields. We then used the STICS model to compare four intercropping management scenarios differing in terms of the date of red fescue emergence, over 35 climatic years. We found that, in most climatic scenarios, the emergence of the fescue crop during the late tillering phase of the wheat crop gave the best compromise between wheat yield overall nitrogen accumulation and radiation interception. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The species × location interaction was of great importance in explaining the behaviour of genetic material. The study presented here shows, for the first time, the performance, under field conditions of the new tritordeum species, compared to wheat and triticale in a wide range of Mediterranean countries (Spain, Lebanon and Tunisia). The results obtained revealed that despite the diversity of environmental conditions, the main differences in yield were due to genotypes, especially to differences between species. The multi-local study with different growth conditions revealed important information about the water availability effect on yield. In the lowest yielding environments (Tunisia rainfed), Tritordeum and triticale yields were equivalent. However under better growth conditions (Spain), tritordeum yield was shown to be lower than wheat and triticale. Interestingly, when water limitation was extended during the pre-anthesis period, differences in tritordeum versus wheat-triticale yield rate were larger than when water stress occurred during anthesis. These variations were explained by the fact that kernel weight has been found as the limiting factor for yield determination in tritordeum, and a delay in the anthesis date may have been the cause for the low kernel weight and low yield under Mediterranean drought conditions. Such differences in yield between tritordeum and wheat or triticale could be explained by the fact that tritordeum is a relatively new species and far fewer resources have been devoted to its improvement when compared to wheat and triticale. Our results suggest that breeding efforts should be directed to an earlier anthesis date and a longer grain filling period. Tritordeum proved to have possibilities to be grown under drought environments as a new crop, since its performance was quite close to wheat and triticale. Besides, it has qualitative added values that may improve farmers' income per unit land. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Eight rice cultivars released in 1905, 1919, 1941, 1954, 1971, 1984, 1987 and 1988 were investigated to identify the traits that contributed to high yield and low soil nitrogen tolerance breeding under cold environment. They were grown in fields at three different nitrogen (N) fertilizer treatments, 0, 6 and 12 g N m-2 (0 N, 6 N and 12 N) in Sapporo, Northern Japan, in 2001 and 2002. All cultivars increased their grain yield (GY) with the increase in soil N availability, and better response to N was observed in modern cultivars released during 1984-1988 compared to old ones (1905-1954). Irrespective of N treatments, the modern cultivars showed better GY than the older ones. Absolute genetic gain was 2.15 or 2.94 g m-2 year-1 at 6 N and 12 N. Under 0 N treatment, although the magnitude of yield increase was small, the genetic gain in GY was still observed at 0.78 g m-2 year-1. The GY increments were achieved mainly through increasing the number of spikelets (SPK) which depends on the number of panicle (PAN) at any level, and the PAN could be increased by enhancing the number of tillers. The extinction coefficient (k) showed that the older cultivars had a spreading plant type, on the other hand, the modern cultivars had an erect plant type which seemed to be a better plant structure in terms of light distribution. This change on plant structure would allow the modern cultivars to have a larger LAI with improved light capturing resulting in better GY in modern cultivars than the old cultivars having similar LAI with modern cultivars. These breeding strategies could work for the high-yielding rice breeding program under cold environments irrespective of soil nitrogen conditions. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The grain legume (pulse) faba bean (Vicia faba L.) is grown world-wide as a protein source for food and feed. At the same time faba bean offers ecosystem services such as renewable inputs of nitrogen (N) into crops and soil via biological N2 fixation, and a diversification of cropping systems. Even though the global average grain yield has almost doubled during the past 50 years the total area sown to faba beans has declined by 56% over the same period. The season-to-season fluctuations in grain yield of faba bean and the progressive replacement of traditional farming systems, which utilized legumes to provide N to maintain soil N fertility, with industrialized, largely cereal-based systems that are heavily reliant upon fossil fuels (=N fertilizers, heavy mechanization) are some of the explanations for this decline in importance. Past studies of faba bean in cropping systems have tended to focus on the effect of faba bean as a pre-crop in mainly cereal intensive rotations, whereas similar information on the effect of preceding crops on faba bean is lacking. Faba bean has the highest average reliance on N2 fixation for growth of the major cool season grain legumes. As a consequence the N benefit for following crops is often high, and several studies have demonstrated substantial savings (up to 100-200 kg N ha-1) in the amount of N fertilizer required to maximize the yield of crops grown after faba bean. There is, however, a requirement to evaluate the potential risks of losses of N from the plant-soil system associated with faba bean cropping via nitrate leaching or emissions of N2O to the atmosphere as a consequence of the rapid mineralization of N from its N-rich residues. It is important to develop improved preventive measures, such as catch crops, intercropping, or no-till technologies, in order to provide farmers with strategies to minimize any possible undesirable effects on the environment that might result from their inclusion of faba bean in cropping system. This needs to be combined with research that can lead to a reduction in the current extent of yield variability, so that faba bean may prove to be a key component of future arable cropping systems where declining supplies and high prices of fossil energy are likely to constrain the affordability and use of fertilizers. This will help address the increasing demand by consumers and governments for agriculture to reduce its impact on the environment and climate through new, more sustainable approaches to food production. The aims of this paper are to review the role of faba bean in global plant production systems, the requirements for optimal faba bean production and to highlight the beneficial effects of faba bean in cropping systems. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Smallholder farmers in East-Africa commonly intercrop maize (Zea mays L.) with grain legumes to maximize utilisation of land and labour, and attain larger crop yields. Conventionally, one legume line is intercropped between each pair of maize lines. This study evaluated the potential of a modified two-by-two staggered arrangement (MBILI) to increase crop yields and economic benefits in two sites in Central Kenya with contrasting soil fertility levels during 7 consecutive seasons. Common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) were grown as legume intercrops. The MBILI system resulted in increased maize yields in both sites, and increased cowpea yields in the poor site. In the fertile site, using beans as an intercrop was most profitable, and the MBILI system increased net benefits by 40%, relative to the conventional system. In the poor site, groundnut and cowpea were better adapted, and the MBILI system increased net benefit by 12-37%. Positive effects of the MBILI system were most pronounced in the poor site, but occurred independent of soil fertility level. Rainfall amounts and distribution varied widely, but the MBILI system increased yields both under conditions of ample and inadequate rainfall. N balances were negative with beans and groundnut, but neutral with cowpea as the intercrop. A modest N fertilizer application is therefore essential to sustain yields in the long term, especially when beans or groundnuts are intercropped. In conclusion, the MBILI system, when combined with adjusted nutrient inputs, resulted in superior and robust improvements in crop yields and economic benefits, relative to the conventional intercropping system. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The understanding of the interactive effect of water and N availability, associated with the ability of crops to efficiently use these resources, is a crucial issue for stabilizing cereal production in Mediterranean areas. A 3-year side by side experiment on durum wheat and barley, under different water regimes and nitrogen levels, was carried out in a typical Mediterranean environment of Southern Italy, to identify the outstanding features of these species that contribute to enhanced grain yield and improved water and nitrogen use efficiency. Wheat and barley response was assessed under three water supply regimes (I100, I50, I0: full irrigation, 50% of full irrigation and rainfed) coupled with two N fertilizer levels (high N: 120 kg ha-1 and low N: not fertilized). In order to evaluate barley yield response under lower N rates, 60 kg ha-1 were applied in 2006. The occurrence of abundant rainfall during the experimental period determined only mild water stress during most of the growing season, especially in 2006 and 2007. Under these conditions, nitrogen fertilization was the main factor affecting crop response, and different crop traits in response to irrigation were primarily evident on tissue N concentrations. Grain number per unit land area explained a high proportion of grain yield and it was mainly influenced by N fertilization. Water availability enhanced N absorption: the response of both crops to N fertilization, in terms of N uptaken and grain N concentration, was higher in the year characterized by greater water availability during the most sensitive stages to drought stress. Under unfertilized conditions, the two crops showed similar response in terms of number of grains per unit land area; under N fertilization, barley exhibited a higher increase in number of grains per unit land area, but wheat achieved similar yields as consequence of the higher grain weight. In years characterized by similar average productivity of wheat, barley did not show further increase in number of seeds, even doubling the rate of N supplied. By increasing irrigation water supply, the two crops showed a similar yield response, but a different N partition, as confirmed by the lower nitrogen harvest index values for barley over 2007-2008. At similar total availability of N, barley reached higher N utilization efficiency than wheat, mainly because of a lower N concentration in the grain rather than a higher efficiency in using the available N. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Dryland farming strategies in the High Plains must make efficient use of limited and variable precipitation and stored water in the soil profile for stable and sustainable farm productivity. Current research efforts focus on replacing summer fallow in the region with more profitable and environmentally sustainable spring and summer crops. In the absence of reliable precipitation forecasts for the crop growing season, farmers rely mainly upon knowledge of plant available water (PAW) in the soil profile at planting for making crop choice decisions. To develop a decision support strategy for crop selection based on initial PAW, experiments were conducted with spring triticale (X Titicosecale Wittmack), proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.), and foxtail millet (Setaria italica L. Beauv.) under artificially controlled Low, Medium, and High initial PAW levels during 2004 and 2005 at Akron, Colorado, and Sidney, Nebraska. The objectives of this study were to adapt an existing cropping systems model for the simulation of triticale and millet and to evaluate simulations from the adapted model by comparing results with field data collected under varying initial PAW conditions. The Root Zone Water Quality Model with DSSAT v4.0 crop growth modules (RZWQM2) was used. Specifically, the Cropping System Model (CSM)-CERES-Wheat module was adapted for simulating triticale, and CSM-CERES-Sorghum (v4.0) module was adapted for simulating proso millet and foxtail millet. Soil water, leaf area index, grain yield, and biomass data for the highest PAW treatment from one crop season for each of the three crops were used to adapt and calibrate the crop modules. The models were then evaluated with data from the remaining PAW treatments. The proso millet module was further tested with four years of data from a crop rotation experiment at Akron from 2003 to 2006. Simulation results indicated that the adapted and calibrated crop modules have the potential to simulate these new crops under a range of varying water availability conditions. Consequently, these models can aid in the development of decision support tools for the season-to-season management of these summer fallow replacement crops under dryland conditions in semi-arid environments.

AB  - The APSIM model was used to assess the impact of legumes on sorghum grown in rotation in a nutrient-limited system under dry conditions in south-western Zimbabwe. An experiment was conducted at Lucydale, Matopos Research Station, between 2002 and 2005. The model was used to simulate soil and plant responses in the experiment. Sequences of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) were used in the rotations. Legumes accumulated up to 130 kg of N ha-1 which was potentially available for uptake by sorghum in the following season. The APSIM model predicted total biomass, grain and N yields of the legume phase within the experimental error and performed well in predicting sorghum yield and N supplied in the rotation after cowpea and groundnut. The model generally under-predicted sorghum total biomass and grain yield after pigeonpea. Observed patterns of crop water use, evaporative losses during the dry season and re-charge of soil profile at the start of the rainy season were generally well predicted by the model. An assessment of output on sorghum N and water stresses in the rotation indicated that the legume-cereal rotation is more driven by soil nitrogen availability than water availability even under semi-arid conditions. Further legume-cereal rotation analysis using the model will assist in the understanding of other processes in the rotations in dry environments. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although relationships among soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr) seed yield, nitrogen (N) uptake, biological N2 fixation (BNF), and response to N fertilization have received considerable coverage in the scientific literature, a comprehensive summary and interpretation of these interactions with specific emphasis on high yield environments is lacking. Six hundred and thirty-seven data sets (site-year-treatment combinations) were analyzed from field studies that had examined these variables and had been published in refereed journals from 1966 to 2006. A mean linear increase of 0.013 Mg soybean seed yield per kg increase in N accumulation in aboveground biomass was evident in these data. The lower (maximum N accumulation) and upper (maximum N dilution) boundaries for this relationship had slopes of 0.0064 and 0.0188 Mg grain kg-1 N, respectively. On an average, 50-60% of soybean N demand was met by biological N2 fixation. In most situations the amount of N fixed was not sufficient to replace N export from the field in harvested seed. The partial N balance (fixed N in aboveground biomass - N in seeds) was negative in 80% of all data sets, with a mean net soil N mining of -40 kg N ha-1. However, when an average estimated belowground N contribution of 24% of total plant N was included, the average N balance was close to neutral (-4 kg N ha-1). The gap between crop N uptake and N supplied by BNF tended to increase at higher seed yields for which the associated crop N demand is higher. Soybean yield was more likely to respond to N fertilization in high-yield (&gt;4.5 Mg ha-1) environments. A negative exponential relationship was observed between N fertilizer rate and N2 fixation when N was applied on the surface or incorporated in the topmost soil layers. Deep placement of slow-release fertilizer below the nodulation zone, or late N applications during reproductive stages, may be promising alternatives for achieving a yield response to N fertilization in high-yielding environments. The results from many N fertilization studies are often confounded by insufficiently optimized BNF or other management factors that may have precluded achieving BNF-mediated yields near the yield potential ceiling. More studies will be needed to fully understand the extent to which the N requirements of soybean grown at potential yields levels can be met by optimizing BNF alone as opposed to supplementing BNF with applied N. Such optimization will require evaluating new inoculant technologies, greater temporal precision in crop and soil management, and most importantly, detailed measurements of the contributions of soil N, BNF, and the efficiency of fertilizer N uptake throughout the crop cycle. Such information is required to develop more reliable guidelines for managing both BNF and fertilizer N in high-yielding environments, and also to improve soybean simulation models. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Economic justification for varying fertiliser inputs to match crop yield potential of different areas or zones in fields is limited by lack of understanding of the relationship between the extent of within-field yield variation and economic gains from zone versus uniform management. We conducted a survey of yield monitor data from 199 fields on the northern sandplain of the wheatbelt in Western Australia in order to document the extent of sub-field yield variation and test if variation is related to attributes such as yield and field area. The economic significance to zone management of the yield variation found in the survey along with variation in size of management zones, costs and prices, and soil fertility status was then assessed using a simple nutrient response model. Considerable variation occurred in yield within fields. Standard deviation varied from 0.2 to 1.2 t/ha and the difference in yield between the highest and lowest yielding thirds of each field varied from 0.5 t/ha in the least to 3.3 t/ha in the most variable field. Both small and large (10-172 ha), and low and high (0.6-4.9 t/ha) yielding fields exhibited variation that was potentially worth managing from an economic standpoint. Model results showed that the larger the difference in potential yield between zones, the greater the economic benefit from zone management. While yield contrast within fields can be increased with more zones, the economic advantage of more zones was small for the cases studied here. The potential economic benefits (from <$5 to $44/ha) increased with higher grain and fertiliser prices and depended on levels of soil nutrients in the different zones. Capturing the full value of the economic benefits in practice requires an accurate indication of yield potential in the different zones at the time when the fertiliser decision is being made. Yield maps can be utilised by growers to give estimates of within-field variation in yield potential and hence potential economic gains from variable rate application of fertiliser. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hanfets is a popular mixture of wheat and barley grown in the highlands of Eritrea and Tigray (Northern Ethiopia). In this study, we tested 16 experimental hanfets constituting all possible combinations of four barley landraces and four wheat (two landraces and two varieties) at three locations in Eritrea for 3 years during which farmers (both men and women) made selections of suitable hanfets. Across locations and years, the grain yield of hanfets on average was similar to that of the pure barley but significantly higher than that of wheat. The analysis of the land equivalent ratio did not reveal differences between the hanfets but showed an average advantage of 50% by growing hanfets as compared to the pure crops. The stability analysis showed that the most stable entries always included some hanfets but that not all hanfets were necessarily more stable than the pure crops. The interactions of the hanfets with locations and years within locations were never significant while they were significant for some of the characters in the case of pure barley and pure wheat. We did not find major differences in selection between men and women: they both selected for high grain yield, earliness, short heads, low kernel weight and short plants. They appear to prefer those hanfets in which both components are early heading and maturing. We argue that because of possible differences in root architecture, the hanfets may exploit more efficiently water resources than pure crops. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper investigates management and cultivar type effects on pearl millet stover yield and fodder quality. Sixteen pearl millet cultivars available to farmers in India were selected to represent three cultivar types: (1) traditional landrace germplasm from the arid/semi-arid millet production zones, (2) improved dual-purpose (grain and stover) open-pollinated varieties incorporating differing amounts of traditional landrace germplasm and (3) commercial, grain-type F1 hybrids, bred for use in the arid/semi-arid zone. The cultivars were grown for 2 years (2000 and 2001) at high fertility (HF: 65 kg N ha-1 and 18 kg P ha-1) and low fertility (LF: 21 kg N ha-1 and 9 kg P ha-1). Within each fertility level high (HP) and low (LP) plant population densities were established by varying sowing rate and then thinning to the target populations (HP: 11 plants m-2 and LP: 5 plants m-2). Stover fodder quality traits (nitrogen concentration, sugar content, in vitro digestibility and metabolizable energy content) were analyzed using a combination of conventional laboratory analysis and near infrared spectroscopy. In general, fertility level and cultivar type had strong effects on grain and stover yields, and on a range of stover nutritional quality traits, but with significant year interactions. In contrast, the effect of population density on these variables was largely insignificant. Higher fertilizer application significantly increased grain and stover yields and stover nitrogen concentration, in vitro digestibility and metabolizable energy content. As a result, fertilization resulted in significant increases in the yields of both digestible and metabolizable stover. Landrace cultivars as a group produced higher quality fodder than modern hybrids, but at a significant cost in grain yield. Dual-purpose, open-pollinated cultivars were generally intermediate between the landraces and hybrids, in terms of both stover quality and grain yield, but produced the highest yields of both digestible and metabolizable stover. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for Indian pearl millet farmers with various resource levels and farming objectives. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper investigates the variation in laboratory fodder quality traits in stover of 16 cultivars of pearl millet grown over 2 consecutive years and subjected to two different fertilizer regimes and planting densities. Stover quality traits were nitrogen and sugar content, in vitro digestibility and metabolizable energy content as well as yield of digestible and metabolizable stover. Significant (P &lt; 0.05) cultivar-dependent variations were observed for all these quality traits. Stover nitrogen contents were mostly below the levels (1.2% of dry matter) considered to be the minimum required for efficient feed digestion in the rumen, but choice of cultivar plus nitrogen fertilizer application could raise nitrogen levels to near, equal or above this threshold. Stover sugar contents were below 5% and mostly concentrated in the stems. Across management regimes stover in vitro digestibility varied by about 4% units, and by about 3-5% units within individual management regimes. Stover metabolizable energy contents of cultivars varied such that stover from superior cultivars could provide the energy maintenance requirement of livestock and theoretically moderate levels of live weight gains, while livestock fed on stover from poor cultivars would lose live weight. Yields of digestible and metabolizable stover (yield of stover dry matter times stover in vitro digestibility/metabolizable energy) varied among cultivars by at least 1.7-fold. Stover quality traits and grain yields of cultivars were largely unrelated (P &gt; 0.05) suggesting that high stover quality will not be achieved on the expense of grain yield. Heritabilities for stover quality traits were high (h2 &gt; 0.73) except for stover nitrogen content (h2 &gt; 0.56). © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Consumer demand regarding the impacts of conventional agriculture on the environment and human health have spurred the growth of organic farming systems; however, organic agriculture is often criticized as low-yielding and unable to produce enough food to supply the world's population. Using wheat as a model crop species, we show that poorly adapted cultivars are partially responsible for the lower yields often found in organic farming systems when compared with conventional farming systems. Our results demonstrate that the highest yielding soft white winter wheat genotypes in conventional systems are not the highest yielding genotypes in organic systems. An analysis of variance for yield among 35 genotypes between paired organic and conventional systems showed highly significant (P &lt; 0.001) genotype × system interactions in four of five locations. Genotypic ranking analysis using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (RS) showed no correlation between genotypic rankings for yield in four of five locations; however, the ranks were correlated for test weight at all five locations. This indicates that increasing yield in organic systems through breeding will require direct selection within organic systems rather than indirect selection in conventional systems. Direct selection in organic systems produced yields 15%, 7%, 31% and 5% higher than the yields resulting from indirect selection for locations 1-4, respectively. With crop cultivars bred in and adapted to the unique conditions inherent in organic systems, organic agriculture will be better able to realize its full potential as a high-yielding alternative to conventional agriculture.

AB  - Drought is by far the most important environmental factor contributing to crop yield loss, especially in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] where symbiotic fixation of atmospheric nitrogen (N2) is sensitive to even modest soil water deficits. Decline of N2 fixation with soil drying causes yield reductions due to inadequate N for protein production, which is the critical seed product. In this paper, we present a combined physiological and breeding research effort to develop soybean lines that have diminished sensitivity of N2 fixation to drought. A preliminary physiological screen was used to identify lines that potentially expressed N2 fixation drought tolerance. One hundred progeny lines derived from a cross between Jackson, a cultivar proven to have N2 fixation tolerance to drought, and KS4895, a high-yielding line, were tested in the screen. Seventeen lines were identified for subsequent yield trials in moderate- and low-yielding rainfed environments. Two lines, found to have higher yields than commercial checks in these environments were then tested in the greenhouse for their N2 fixation activity in drying soil. Nitrogen fixation activity was found to persist at lower soil water contents than exhibited by the sensitive parent. These two soybean lines offer a genetic resource for increased yields under rainfed conditions as a result of decreased sensitivity of N2 fixation to water deficit. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Timely sowing is critical for achieving high grain yields in winter cereals. However, inadequate seed-zone moisture for germination commonly delays sowing to reduce biomass and subsequent yield in semi-arid environments. Sowing deep to reach soil moisture is often avoided by growers of Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b semi-dwarf wheat as these wheat show poor emergence when sown deep. Their reduced cell elongation associated with insensitivity to endogenous gibberellins, results in shorter coleoptiles and smaller early leaf area. Alternative dwarfing genes responsive to endogenous gibberellins (e.g. Rht8) are available for use in wheat breeding. These reduce plant height without affecting coleoptile length and offer potential to select longer coleoptile wheat for deep sowing. Nine semidwarf (Rht8, Rht-B1b, and Rht-D1b) and seven tall (rht) wheat genotypes were sown at depths of 50, 80 and 110 mm at three locations in 2 or 3 years. Coleoptile lengths measured in a growth cabinet at four temperatures (11, 15, 19 and 23 °C) were strongly correlated with coleoptile length (rp = 0.77-0.79**) and plant number (rp = 0.49*-0.79**) in deep-sown plots in the field. Furthermore, differences in coleoptile length were genetically correlated with greater numbers of emerged seedlings (rg = 0.97**), shallower crown depth (-0.58**), greater seedling leaf area (0.59**) and seedling biomass (0.44*). Wheat containing the Rht-B1b or Rht-D1b dwarfing genes produced significantly (P &lt; 0.01) shorter coleoptiles (97 mm) than both Rht8 (118 mm) and tall (117 mm) wheat. In turn, compared with emergence from 50 mm depth, the Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b wheat produced significantly fewer seedlings at 110 mm sowing depth (-62%) than either Rht8 (-41%) or tall (-37%) wheat. Effects of deep sowing early in the season were maintained with reductions in spike number and biomass at both anthesis and maturity. Kernel number was also reduced with deep sowing leading to reductions in grain yield. Over all entries, genotypic increases in plant number were associated with increases in fertile spike (rg = 0.61**) and kernel number (0.21*), total biomass (0.26*) and grain yield (0.28*). Reduction in spike number and grain yield with deep sowing was smallest for the Rht8 (-18 and -10%) and rht (-15 and -7%) wheat, and largest for the Rht-B1b/D1b (-39 and -16%) wheat. Plant height and coleoptile length were independent among Rht8 and tall wheat genotypes. This study demonstrates the importance of good seedling emergence in achieving high wheat yields, and the potential use of alternative dwarfing genes such as Rht8 in development of long coleoptile, reduced height wheat suitable for deep sowing. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Greenwaste compost (12 months from windrowing) with the potential to suppress Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici was evaluated under field conditions for the reduction of yield losses in winter wheat arising from take-all disease. Two field trials, one examining compost efficacy to determine the amount of compost required to reduce take-all severity and another, with phased applications of compost to determine residual and cumulative effects of compost application, were conducted during three complete cropping cycles, covering the second to fourth years of wheat monoculture after pasture. Application of 100 and 150 Mg ha-1 greenwaste compost ameliorated the effects of take-all during a cropping period with high disease pressure. Grain yield increases of 1 Mg ha-1 were associated strongly with the suppression of take-all disease and had physiological origins in improved plant growth and grain quality. However, no residual or cumulative effects of compost application on take-all disease were detectable within the duration of the field trials. Based on economic analysis, application of 100 Mg ha-1 compost was more cost-effective than 150 Mg ha-1. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Continuous adoption of rice-wheat cropping system (RWCS) has led to depletion of inherent soil fertility resulting in a serious threat to its sustainability in the Indo-Gangetic plain region (IGPR) of India. The inclusion of legumes in RWCS assumes a great significance to restore soil fertility. But farmers in the IGPR rarely grow legumes in the system. We, therefore, carried out farmers' participatory diagnostic survey in the Upper Gangetic plain zone (UGP) to understand farmers' fertilizer management practices for wheat (Trititicum aestivum L. Emend Fiori &amp; Paol) following rice (Oryza sativa L.) or pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan(L.)Millsp). The survey indicated that most of the farmers in UGP grew pigeonpea in place of rice under RWCS as only a break crop at a 2-3 year interval. The farmers applied, on average, 11 kg N ha-1 and 24 kg P ha-1 to wheat sown after rice, and 12 kg N ha -1 and 19 kg P ha-1 to wheat sown after pigeonpea. Wheat yields, however, were lower (3.3 t ha-1) when sown after pigeonpea than after rice (3.7 t ha-1). The survey was followed by a field experiment at Modipuram (29°4′ N), Meerut, India that continued during the three consecutive years (1998-1999 to 2000-2001) to examine the effect of inclusion of pigeonpea in place of rice on soil fertility, N and P use efficiency and yields of wheat. In 1998-1999, wheat yields after pigeonpea were lower than after rice, but improved significantly (p &lt; 0.05) by 11.4-15.1% in pigeonpea plots compared with those in rice plots during 1999-2000 and 2000-2001, respectively. The use efficiency of applied N and P fertilizers in wheat, measured as agronomic efficiency and apparent recovery, was increased with combined use of fertilizer N and P at recommended rate, and also with inclusion of pigeonpea in place of rice. The post-wheat harvest NO3-N in soil profile beyond 45 cm depth was significantly greater under rice-wheat system than under pigeonpea-wheat system, suggesting that inclusion of pigeonpea may help in minimizing NO3-N leaching to deeper profile layers beyond root zone. Similarly, in the treatments receiving both 120 kg N and 26 kg P ha-1, NO3-N beyond 45 cm soil depth was lower compared to those receiving N or P alone. Inclusion of pigeonpea in place of rice enhanced carbon accumulation in the soil profile. The available P content was, however, invariably low under pigeonpea plots as compared to that under rice. With continuous rice-wheat cropping, the bulk density (BD) of soil was increased, especially in the 30-45 cm soil profile. Inclusion of pigeonpea in the system not only helped maintaining soil BD at initial level in the surface (0-15 cm) soil layers, but also in decreasing (p &lt; 0.05) BD in sub-surface layers (15-30 cm and 30-45 cm). Compared to rice, a statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) positive effect of pigeonpea on root volume (58%) and root weight (99.5%) of succeeding wheat was also recorded. The net economic returns under pigeonpea-wheat system were greater compared with rice-wheat system. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A 3-year field experiment examined the effects of non-flooded mulching cultivation and traditional flooding and four fertilizer N application rates (0, 75, 150 and 225 kg ha -1 for rice and 0, 60,120, and 180 kg N ha -1 for wheat) on grain yield, N uptake, residual soil N min and the net N balance in a rice-wheat rotation on Chengdu flood plain, southwest China. There were significant grain yield responses to N fertilizer. Nitrogen applications of &gt;150 kg ha -1 for rice and &gt;120 kg ha -1 for wheat gave no increase in crop yield but increased crop N uptake and N balance surplus in both water regimes. Average rice grain yield increased by 14% with plastic film mulching and decreased by 16% with wheat straw mulching at lower N inputs compared with traditional flooding. Rice grain yields under SM were comparable to those under PM and TF at higher N inputs. Plastic film mulching of preceding rice did not affect the yield of succeeding wheat but straw mulching had a residual effect on succeeding wheat. As a result, there was 17-18% higher wheat yield under N0 in SM than those in PM and TF. Combined rice and wheat grain yields under plastic mulching was similar to that of flooding and higher than that of straw mulching across N treatments. Soil mineral N (top 60 cm) after the rice harvest ranged from 50 to 65 kg ha -1 and was unaffected by non-flooded mulching cultivation and N rate. After the wheat harvest, soil N min ranged from 66 to 88 kg N ha -1 and increased with increasing fertilizer N rate. High N inputs led to a positive N balance (160-621 kg ha -1), but low N inputs resulted in a negative balance (-85 to -360 kg ha -1). Across N treatments, the net N balances of SM were highest among the three cultivations systems, resulting from additional applied wheat straw (79 kg ha -1) as mulching materials. There was not clear trend found in net N balance between PM and TF. Results from this study indicate non-flooded mulching cultivation may be utilized as an alternative option for saving water, using efficiently straw and maintaining or improving crop yield in rice-wheat rotation systems. There is the need to evaluate the long-term environmental risks of non-flooded mulching cultivation and improve system productivity (especially with straw mulching) by integrated resource management. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.) crop retains appreciable amounts of green foliage even after reaching physiological maturity, which if allowed to defoliate, could augment the residual benefit of pigeonpea to the following wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in a pigeonpea-wheat rotation. The effect of addition of leaves present on mature pigeonpea crop to the soil was examined on the following wheat during the 1999/2000 growing season at Patancheru (17°4′N, 78°2′E) and during the 2001-2003 growing seasons at Modipuram (29°4′N, 77°8′E). At Patancheru, an extra-short-duration pigeonpea cultivar ICPL 88039 was defoliated manually and using foliar sprays of 10% urea (30 kg/ha) and compared with a millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R.Br.) crop, naturally senesced leaf residue and no-leaf residue controls. At Modipuram, the effect of 10% urea spray treatment on mature ICPL 88039 was compared with the unsprayed control. At both locations, the rainy season crops were followed by a wheat cultivar UP 2338 at four nitrogen levels applied in a split plot design, which at Patancheru were 0, 30, 90 and 120 kg N ha-1 and at Modipuram 0, 60, 120 and 180 kg N ha -1. At Patancheru, urea spray added 0.5 t ha-1 of extra leaf litter to the soil within a week without significantly affecting pigeonpea yield. This treatment, however, increased mean wheat yield by 29% from 2.4 t ha-1 in the no-leaf residue pigeonpea or pearl millet plots to 3.1 t ha-1. At Modipuram, the foliar sprays of urea added more leaf litter to the soil than at Patancheru. Here, increase in subsequent wheat yield due to additional pigeonpea leaf litter was 7-8% and net profit 21% more than in the unsprayed control. The addition of pigeonpea leaf litter to the soil resulted in a saving of 40-60 kg N for the following wheat crops in both the environments. The results demonstrated that pigeonpea leaf litter could play an important role in the fertilizer N economy in wheat. The urea spray at maturity of the standing pigeonpea crop significantly improved this contribution in increasing wheat yield, the effect of which was additional to the amount of urea used for inducing defoliation. The practice, if adopted by farmers, may enhance sustainability of wheat production system in an environmentally friendly way, as it could reduce the amount of fertilizer N application to soil and enhance wheat yield. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A new maize (Zea mays L.) simulation model, Hybrid-Maize, was developed by combining the strengths of two modeling approaches: the growth and development functions in maize-specific models represented by CERES-Maize, and the mechanistic formulation of photosynthesis and respiration in generic crop models such as INTERCOM and WOFOST. It features temperature-driven maize phenological development, vertical canopy integration of photosynthesis, organ-specific growth respiration, and temperature-sensitive maintenance respiration. The inclusion of gross assimilation, growth respiration and maintenance respiration makes the Hybrid-Maize model potentially more responsive to changes in environmental conditions than models such as CERES-Maize. Hybrid-Maize also requires fewer genotype-specific parameters without sacrificing prediction accuracy. A linear relationship between growing degree-days (GDD) from emergence to silking and GDD from emergence to physiological maturity was used for prediction of day of silking when the former is not available. The total GDD is readily available for most commercial maize hybrids. Preliminary field evaluations at two locations under high-yielding growth conditions indicated close agreement between simulated and measured values for leaf area, dry matter accumulation, final grain and stover yields, and harvest index (HI). Key areas for further model improvement include LAI prediction at high plant density, and biomass partitioning, carbohydrate translocation, and maintenance respiration in response to above-average temperature, especially during reproductive growth. The model has not been evaluated under conditions of water and/or nutrient stress, and efforts are currently in progress to develop and validate water and nitrogen balance components for the Hybrid-Maize model. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A field experiment on a sandy loam was conducted to evaluate the effects of non-flooded mulching cultivation on the productivity, nutrient uptake and nutrient balance in rice-wheat (R-W) cropping systems in Chengdu flood plain, southwest China over a 3-year period. Plastic film mulching (PM) resulted in 12% higher average yield of rice while wheat straw mulching (SM) led to 14% lower average yield of rice compared with lowland rice under traditional flooding (TF). Biomass accumulation and nutrient uptake followed similar trends to grain yield. Changes in soil temperature in relation to root growth and nutrient uptake were likely to be the major factor responsible for the changes in rice yields under non-flooded mulching cultivation. Compared with TF, PM of preceding rice did not affect the grain yield of wheat, whereas SM of preceding rice resulted in comparable grain yields of wheat at a lower N rate (60 kg N ha-1) in the wheat season. The system productivity (total yield of rice + wheat) in PM was similar to that of TF and higher than that of SM. The yield decline in rice, however, could be partly compensated by the yield increase in wheat following rice, particularly at lower N rates. Apparent nutrient budgets showed positive nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) balances but negative potassium (K) balance in the TF and non-flooded mulching R-W systems. Compared with TF, PM led to lower NPK balance due to more nutrient removal by crops while SM led to greater NPK balance due to more nutrient inputs from straw but less nutrient removal by crops. After 3 years soil organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) were not significantly altered by PM and SM but soil Olsen-P (AP) and exchangeable K (EK) were significantly increased by SM compared with TE The changes in soil properties under non-flooded mulching cultivation initially reflected the nutrient balances in R-W systems. In conclusion, non-flooded mulching cultivation as PM and SM could be applied to R-W systems in southwest China but nutrient (especially N) management should be optimized in the two systems. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Nitrogen dynamics and budgets in a clay loam soil (Meadow Aqualf) in the North China Plain were investigated in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) cropping system comparing the effects of four N rates (0, 120, 240 and 360 kg N ha-1 as urea) applied twice to each crop over 2 years. Ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) in the soil profile remained at a low and constant level (except in the surface 20 cm layer) following application of fertilizer N. In contrast, nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) levels were significantly altered by the rate of applied N. A strong tendency of NO3-N to move from the surface layer to the lower layers (20-100 cm) was observed during the wheat and maize growth seasons in treatments of 240 and 360 kg N ha-1 per crop (N240 and N360). The amounts of NO3-N accumulated in the soil profile were significantly higher in N240 and N360 than those in NO and N 120 (treatments receiving 0 and 120 kg N ha-1 per crop). After 2 years, soil NO3-N levels at 0-300 cm depth in N 120, N240 and N360 amounted to 336, 815 and 1141 kg ha-1, respectively, with more than half of these amounts distributed in the 100-300 cm layer. The calculated total N balance indicates that most fertilizer N was available as NO3-N in the top 300 cm of the soil profile using traditional fertilization and irrigation practices. Over the subsequent 2 years, N losses were calculated to be relatively low in N 120 but significantly higher in N240 and N360. Measured gaseous N losses showed that NH3 volatilization and denitrification comprised only a small fraction of total N losses during the 2-year rotation, while NO3-N leaching from the top 100 cm of the soil profile accounted for most N losses across all N rates and experimental years. The N budget showed that accumulation and/or leaching of NO3-N below 100 cm depth (beyond the reach of most roots) was the main pathway for N losses in the winter wheat-maize cropping system. The recommended N application rate of 120 kg N ha-1 minimized soil NO3-N accumulation and leaching losses while maintaining high yields and N utilization by winter wheat and maize. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - In the semi-arid tropics, over two-third's of the world's people depend on agriculture within which livestock play a major role in building rural livelihoods. Crop residues (fodder/stover) are important feed resources for ruminants. This review was undertaken with the objective of improving understanding of the role of various crop management factors in affecting the productivity and quality of crop residues. Variability in productivity and quality of residues can be of both genetic and non-genetic origin. Recommended agronomic practices vary according to crop and cultivar and can release the maximum genetic potential determining quantity and quality of residues. Planting method and planting rate recommendations should be followed to maximise productivity. Although low density planting improved fodder quality, fodder yield declined. Time of sowing affected fodder yield in most of the crops, but fodder quality was not generally affected. It was common to observe that application of nitrogen (up to 120 kg ha-1) in cereals and application of phosphorus (up to 60 kg ha-1) in legumes improved the green and dry fodder yields, as well as crude protein (CP), crude fibre (CF) and other quality parameters. Inoculation of cereal seed with nitrogen fixing bacteria such as Azotobacter and seed of pulses with phosphate solubilising bacteria has been reported to decrease fertiliser needs and improve the CP and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) of fodder. Irrigating at more frequent intervals by splitting the same quantity of irrigation water into smaller irrigations and at critical stages improved dry matter and CP yields. Hand weeding resulted in better weed control efficiency and stover yield than application of herbicides. However, application of herbicides resulted in the greatest benefit:cost ratio. Manual harvesting resulted in lower losses than mechanical harvesting, and may affect quality depending on the extent of loss of different fodder components. Drought stress yielded more digestible organic matter due to increases in the proportion of leaves compared to stems. Saline conditions affected seed germination and crop yields. Several methods are suggested to counteract the effects of salinity. Intercropping of cereals with legumes improved fodder nutritional quality (mostly protein content). In almost all crops, a positive association was found between fodder and grain yield indicating simultaneous improvement in both characters. In most cases, fodder yield and digestibility were positively correlated and showed positive association with plant height, leaf number and the number of tillers per plant, but there were limits and variation among crops. The ICRISAT-ILRI partnership experiments were conducted with a diverse set of sorghum and pearl millet cultivars at ICRISAT, India. Planting density levels in both crops did not influence forage quality although some fodder yield traits were affected. A significant interaction of genotype with planting density was observed for grain and fodder yield in sorghum and grain yield and harvest index in pearl millet. Adherence to recommended crop management practices can potentially facilitate the release of the maximum genetic potential determining quality and yield parameters for improved animal production. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The mixed crop-livestock systems of India are underpinned by the crop residues which contribute on an average 40-60% of the total dry matter intake per livestock unit. There is however considerable regional variation in the dominant type of crop residue: rice and wheat straws in irrigated regions compared to coarse cereal straws and hay from leguminous crops in the drier, semi-arid regions. This paper synthesizes a series of recent studies on the role and importance of crop residues and farmers' perceptions of fodder quantity and quality in coarse cereal and groundnut based feeding systems. Crop improvement programs for sorghum, pearl millet and groundnut have traditionally focused on grain/pod yield improvement, pest and water stress tolerance. Only relatively recently have dual-purpose (grain and fodder) plant types been developed. While the nutritive value of fodder from dual-purpose crops can be determined through in vivo and in vitro analysis, such experimental procedures cannot necessarily capture the often-subjective quality attributes that farmers (and their animals) value. Results indicate that farmers perceive a range of quality traits, some of which could be screened for relatively easily, whereas others may be more difficult to assess. These findings highlight the importance of farmer participatory evaluation of fodder traits in the development of improved dual-purpose varieties. However the impact of these varieties on poor farm households will be contingent on the complementary improvement in the effectiveness of seed systems. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A simulation model of pigeonpea is described that is designed to simulate the development, growth, nitrogen accumulation and yield of a wide range of maturity types from extra-short to medium-duration in response to weather, soil conditions and agronomic management. Parameters of the model for phenological development, leaf area expansion, radiation interception, biomass accumulation and partitioning, crop water use, root growth and water extraction, and nitrogen accumulation are derived from published studies. In addition, the calibration exercise is described to derive the parameters accounting for the effect of plant population density on leaf area expansion. The model was tested on 38 data sets, not previously used to derive model parameters, collected at Patancheru, India. Data sets encompassed a wide range of plant type, sowing density, and seasons, grown on alfisol and vertisol soil types under dryland and irrigated conditions. The time to flowering and maturity from the extra-short to medium-duration types were simulated well, explaining 96 and 92% of the variance (RMSD = 4.3 and 9.8 days), respectively. Total aboveground biomass was simulated with less accuracy, explaining 74% of the variance (RMSD = 2056 kg ha-1) and grain yield was simulated explaining 76% of the variance (RMSD = 332 kg ha-1). There remains scope for model improvement in the areas of waterlogging and testing on crop N accumulation. This pigeonpea module, when coupled with other crop, soil and management modules can be used to address a range of cropping systems issues. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Zinc (Zn) deficiency is a critical nutritional problem for plants and humans in Turkey. About 14 Mha of cropped land in Turkey are known to be Zn deficient, particularly cereal growing areas of Anatolia. In 1993, a joint research project was started in Turkey with the financial support of the NATO-Science for Stability Programme to select and characterize cereal genotypes with high yield and/or high Zn accumulation in grain under deficient supply of Zn. Field, greenhouse and growth chamber experiments were carried to study morphological, physiological and genetic factors determining the bases of genotypical differences in Zn efficiency among cereal species and within cultivars of wheat. Among the cereals, rye had particularly high Zn efficiency (high yield under Zn deficiency). There were large genotypical differences among wheat lines. High Zn efficiency was closely associated with enhanced capacity of some lines to take up Zn from soils, but not with increased Zn accumulation per unit dry weight of shoot or grain. Measurement of Zn-containing superoxide dismutase activity in leaves revealed that an efficient utilization of Zn at the tissue or cellular level is an additional major factor involved in Zn efficiency of cereals. Zinc present in grains from Anatolia seems to be not bioavailable. Phytate: Zn molar ratios in grains, a widely accepted predictor of Zn bioavailability, were extremely high and ranged between 95 and 216 for crops grown severely on Zn-deficient soils of Central Anatolia. In the studies concerning determination of Zn nutritional status of school children in Southeastern Anatolia, most children were found to be of shorter stature and had very low levels of Zn (&lt;100 mg kg-1) in hair.

AB  - An experiment in a maize crop evaluated the influence of several types of commercial nitrogenous fertilizers with different action mechanisms - urea (soluble), Floranid-32 (low water solubility) and Multicote 4 (coated fertilizer) - on maize grain and biomass yields, as well as on plant N use. The fertilizers were applied as a top-dressing of 294 kg N ha-1. All treatments additionally received 64 kg N ha-1 as 8.0 (N):6.5 (P):12.5 (K) compound prior to seedbed preparation. The influence of NO-3 content in the irrigation water was also assessed, using water with either 2.5 or 35 mg l-1 of NO-3. Irrigation plus rainfall totalled 513 mm (1.20 potential ET). Nitrogen lost during the cultivation period was calculated from the N balance of the topsoil. Results obtained under these experimental conditions showed that the type of fertilizer did not alter maize grain and biomass yields. Yields for maize irrigated with the higher NO-3 water were systematically greater than those obtained with irrigation water of low NO-3 content. Nitrogen lost from the topsoil during the cultivation period varied between 240 and 280 kg N ha-1 for all treatments, and was well correlated with NO-3-N leached into the aquifer during the same period. © 1995.

AB  - Short-duration pigeonpea suffers from waterlogging damage following heavy rainfall at the pre-flowering stage on soils with high clay content, such as Vertisols. Effects of short-term waterlogging (3 d) on shoot and root growth of short-duration pigeonpea grown on a Vertisol field were quantified, and the alleviation of waterlogging damage by top-dressing of nitrogen fertilizer was examined. Reduced leaf chlorophyll, increased senescence and abscission of lower leaves were observed within 3 d of the initiation of waterlogging. Root growth and symbiotic N2 fixation were also severely impaired. Root distributions of waterlogged plants were shallower than those of the control during the subsequent recovery period because new adventitious roots were formed in the shallow rather than deep soil layer. Yield of waterlogged crops was significantly smaller than the control. Top-dressing of nitrogen at one day after the termination of waterlogging alleviated waterlogging damage either completely or partially. Leaf chlorophyll and shoot dry mass of waterlogged plants were 78 and 84% of the values in control plants immediately after waterlogging but recovered to 92 and 98% of the control values at the pod-filling stage with a top-dressing of 50 kg N ha-1. Nitrogen application promoted root growth in the shallow soil layers during the first 11 d after application, and in the deeper soil layers during the subsequent 16 d. Total nodule activity was significantly reduced by 100 kg N ha-1, but increased by 50 kg N ha-1 around one month after the top-dressing. The reduction in seed yield was largely compensated for by 50 kg N ha-1, because of recovery from waterlogging damage to shoot and root growth involving increased nodule activity. © 1994.

AB  - Classification methodology is widely used by plant breeders to group environments on the results of regional evaluation trials to assist in selection among genotypes. To be effective, this strategy must be integrated with the theory of indirect selection. Environments which group together should reflect commonality of genotypic discrimination and therefore give rise to similar selection among genotypes. Four strategies for classifying environments were compared. These were based on untransformed and three forms of transformed data (coded, standardised and rank). The comparison assessed how effectively the groups of environments formed by using each transformation maximised the opportunity for exploiting indirect selection between environments within the same group relative to environments in other groups. The objective in this study was to identify groups of international environments, used by CIMMYT in its international nursery program, which gave high indirect response to selection for grain yield in six Australian environments. Generally the four classification strategies identified subsets of international environments for which selection gave a greater indirect response than that for selection on average performance across all of the international environments (35% to 94% on average over all Australian environments). Environmental classifications based on the standardised and rank transformations were generally superior to those based on the untransformed and coded transformations (46% on average over all Australian environments). The magnitude of this advantage differed between the Australian environments but was substantial for the two environments which expressed the greatest opportunity for exploiting indirect selection. These results have obvious and large implications for the use of classification methodology to structure regional testing regimes for plant breeding programs. © 1993.

AB  - The effect of environmental factors other than photoperiod on flowering in jute has not been adequately documented. Such knowledge is necessary if control over the flowering process is to be attained. Thus a factorial experiment was conducted in which the main effects and interactions of three genotypes, three day/night temperature regimes, three photoperiods, two levels of water supply and two nitrogen levels were studied. The experiment was conducted in three compartments of a glasshouse in which temperature was manipulated by evaporative coolers and gas-fired heaters and daylength by artificial lighting and light-proof compartments. Photoperiod was the dominant factor controlling flowering, and hence growth habit. There was relatively little effect of temperature on flowering even though night temperatures below 20°C markedly delayed emergence and initial growth. Water stress applied during 35-40 days after germination delayed flowering but nitrogen treatment had no effect. Treatment effects on days to flowering were generally directly proportional to effects on yield parameters. The present results suggest that occasional instances of premature flowering in jute, even though daylength during growth had been adequate, cannot be explained by temperature effects. Thus effects of light intensity or quality may be involved. Further, it is suggested that screening of genotypes for optimum flowering requirements (long vegetative period) may be done on the basis of photoperiod response alone, due to the relatively small effects of other environmental factors on flowering. © 1985.

AB  - Temperature exerts a major effect on the rate at which crop plants develop and on processes of expansion and extension. Light determines the rate of growth (i.e., dry-matter production) at any stage of development. But three are important interactions: development can be slowed by low light and growth can be retarded when the temperature is too high or too low. The simplest development response is that of germination when light is not a factor. Germination rate of pearl millet cv. BK 560 increased linearly with temperature from a base of 10-12°C to a sharply defined optimum at 33-34°C and declined to zero at about 45-47°C. Other developmental processes such as leaf and spikelet initiation and tillering responded similarly to temperature. The limited information available suggests that the base temperature at which development stops is different for contaasting varieties: the rate and the duration of specific developmental processes also differ. Rate of leaf extention is also a linear function of temperature up to about 34°C so that the time needed to form a complete canopy decreases with increasing temperature below that limit. However, the amount of dry matter produced per unit of intercepted radiation appears to be conservative at about 2.4 g/MJ (+10%) for mean air temperatures ranging from 20 to 36°C. The highest yield, both biological and economic, was obtained at 22°C, mainly because the duration of cv. BK 560 was about 30 days longer at 22 than at 31°C, for example. The effects of temperature on the distribution of photosynthate and nitrate and nitrogen uptake in other cultivate of pearl millet are also discussed. Priorities for research are summarised in the Conclusion. © 1985.

AB  - The total N content of soils from long-term fertility plots in two sites in the Philippines was measured by Kjeldahl analysis. One site had grown 24 and the other 17 crops of irrigated rice (Oryza sativa L.). It appears that the total soil N at each site did not decrease during the cropping period. There was little evidence that N, P, or K fertilization affected the total soil N content. Nitrogen (NH4+ and NO3-) input by rainfall varied between 0.6 and 2.4 kg of N/ha per year. Calculations based on crop yields and known N inputs suggest that the two flooded rice crops grown each year resulted in a positive N balance equivalent to 79 and 103 kg N/ha per year. An attempt was made to measure the accumulation of N that may occur in the oxidized surface layer of the soil in the field as a result of N fixation by phototrophic microorganisms during a rice crop. No acetylene reduction activity or accumulation of N (Kjeldahl analysis) was observed in the surface oil when the light was not allowed to penetrate to the water and soil surface. Plots open to the light accumulated the equivalent of approximately 6-8 kg N/ha in the surface soil between transplanting and heading. © 1984.

AB  - Results of an experiment conducted at 14 locations in seven countries during 1976-1979 under the coordination of the East-West Center, Hawaii, are discussed. This study compares the performance of maize-soybean intercrop with the component sole crops at different N levels applied to maize. Intercropping generally gave greater combined yields and monetary returns than obtained from either crop grown alone. On the basis of land equivalent ratio, yield advantage from intercropping varied from 64% at zero N to 42% at 100% of the recommended rate of N application to maize. Returns from intercropping at zero nitrogen were 61% higher than sole maize and 44% higher than sole soybean. Maize-soybean intercrop appears to be particularly well-suited for small farmers in developing countries who operate at subsistence level and use little or no fertilizer. Increased research effort is suggested to identify other crop combinations for use under various ecosystems and management levels, develop efficient methods of fertilising the cereal and to understand benefits of legumes in intercropping. © 1982.
